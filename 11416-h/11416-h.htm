<p><i>Anti-Jacobin, May, 1804.</i></p>
<p>PYE'S DICTIONARY OF ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY.</p>

<p>The author's avowed object, is to arrange the ancient and modern names,
in a clear and methodical manner, so as to give a ready reference to
each; and in addition to this arrangement of ancient appellations both
of people and places, with the modern names, he has given a concise
chronological history of the principal places; by which the book also
serves in many cases as a gazetteer. We find upon the whole a clear and
practical arrangement of articles which are dispersed in more voluminous
works. Mr. Pye has condensed within a narrow space the substance of
Cellarius, Lempriere, Macbean, etc. In short the work will be found very
useful and convenient to all persons reading the classics or studying
modern geography, and to all readers of history, sacred or profane.</p>
<br>

<p><i>British Critic, June, 1804.</i></p>

<p>PYE'S DICTIONARY OF ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY.</p>

<p>This may be recommended as a very convenient, useful, and relatively
cheap publication of the kind, and may very properly be recommended for
schools. The author very modestly desires that such errors and omissions
as will unavoidably appear in an attempt of this nature may be pointed
out to him, for the benefit of a future edition.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Monthly Review, October, 1805.</i></p>

<p>We prefer the old mode of having separate divisions; the one including
ancient and the other modern geography, to that of uniting both under
the same alphabetical arrangement. When the title of this work is
considered, it is somewhat incongruous that the account of places should
be inserted under the modern names, and a mere reference under that of
the ancient. These accounts appear to be in general correct, but they
are in our judgment too brief to be satisfactory. As the above writer
says he prefers two alphabets to one; the editor hereby sets him at
defiance to produce two books in any language (however large they are,)
from whence the student or traveller can collect such information as is
contained in this small volume, price 7s.</p>

<p>Mr. Pye also published a correct and complete representation of all the
provincial copper coins, tokens of trade, and cards of address, on
copper, that were circulated as such between the years 1787 and 1801;
when they were entirely superseded by a national copper coinage. The
whole on fifty-five quarto plates, price 20s. being a necessary
appendage to every library; there being a very copious index.</p>

<p><i>ADVERTISEMENT</i>.</p>

<p>Whoever may take the trouble of looking into the following pages, will
soon perceive that in some instances the editor has been very brief in
his description of the public institutions; to which he pleads guilty,
and accounts for it by observing, that the undermentioned card<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> was
written and delivered by him personally, to every public institution, at
the respective places where the business is transacted, and when he
called again, after a lapse of two months, there were several instances
where all information was withheld.<a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Having, as he thought, proceeded
in the most genteel way, by soliciting assistance in a private manner,
he feels doubly disappointed in not being able to give the public such
information as might reasonably be expected in a publication of this
kind.&mdash;Had his endeavors been seconded by those who are to a certain
degree interested in the event, there are several points that would have
been explained more at large; but being deprived of such assistance, he
ventures to appear before the tribunal of the public, and to give them
the best information that he has been able to obtain. Any person who
discovers errors or omissions, that will take the trouble of rectifying
them, and conveying the same through the medium of the publisher, will
confer an inestimable favour on</p>

<p>Their obedient servant,</p>

<p><i>CHARLES PYE</i>.</p>

<a name="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1">[1]</a><div class=note>&mdash;are respectfully informed, that it is in contemplation to
publish a Description of Modern Birmingham, and the adjacent country for
some miles around it; therefore any information they may think proper to
communicate will be strictly attended to by Their obedient servant,

<p>LINES</p>

<p><i>Written by the late John Morfitt, Esq. Barrister.</i></p>

Illustrious offspring of vulcanic toil!<br>
Pride of the country! glory of the isle!<br>
Europe's grand toy-shop! art's exhaustless mine!<br>
These, and more titles, Birmingham, are thine.<br>
From jealous fears, from charter'd fetters free,<br>
Desponding genius finds a friend in thee:<br>
Thy soul, as lib'ral as the breath of spring,<br>
Cheers his faint heart, and plumes his flagging wing.<br>
<br>
'Tis thine, with plastic hand, to mould the mass,<br>
Of ductile silver, and resplendant brass;<br>
'Tis thine, with sooty finger to produce<br>
Unnumber'd forms, for ornament and use.<br>
<br>
Hark! what a sound!--art's pond'rous fabric reels,<br>
Beneath machinery's ten thousand wheels;<br>
Loud falls the stamp, the whirling lathes resound,<br>
And engines heave, while hammers clatter round:<br>
What labour forges, patient art refines,<br>
Till bright as dazz'ling day metallic beauty shines.<br>
<br>
Thy swords, elastic, arm our hero's hands;<br>
Thy musquets thunder in remotest lands;<br>
Thy sparkling buttons distant courts emblaze;<br>
Thy polish'd steel emits the diamond's rays;<br>
Paper, beneath thy magic hand assumes<br>
A mirror brightness, and with beauty blooms.<br>
With each Etruscan grace thy vases shine,<br>
And proud Japan's fam'd varnish yields to thine.<br>
<br>
Thine, too, the trinkets, that the fair adorn,<br>
But who can count the spangles of the morn?<br>
What pencil can pourtray this splendid mart.<br>
This vast, stupendous wilderness of art?<br>
Where fancy sports, in all her rainbow hues,<br>
And beauty's radiant forms perplex the muse.<br>
The boundless theme transcends poetic lays,&mdash;<br>
Let plain historic truth record thy praise.<br>

<p>TO PLACES DISTANT FROM BIRMINGHAM.</p>

<p>BIRMINGHAM,</p>

<p>EMPHATICALLY TERMED</p>

<p><i>THE TOY-SHOP OF EUROPE.</i></p>

<p>This extensive town, which, from its manufactures, is of so much
importance to the nation, is distinguished in the commercial annals of
Britain, for a spirit of enterprize and persevering industry. Its
inhabitants are ever on the alert, and continually inventing some new
articles for traffic, or making improvements in others, that have been
introduced in foreign countries; and by their superior skill, aided by
machinery, are enabled to bring into the foreign market an endless
variety of manufactured goods, both useful and ornamental, which they
sell at a more moderate price than any other manufacturers of similar
articles in the known world.</p>

<p>Comparisons are odious, and therefore to be avoided. That the
inhabitants are become wealthy, there is indisputable evidence, but to
whom they are indebted for their opulence, different opinions prevail.</p>

<p>The writer of these pages was born in the year 1749, and having been an
attentive observer more than fifty years, he is convinced that the
extensive trade now carried on in this town, is principally to be
attributed to the enterprising spirit of the late Matthew Boulton, Esq.
who, by his active and unremitting exertions, the indefatigable
perseverance of himself and his agents, together with the liberal manner
in which he patronized genius, laid the foundation.</p>

<p>This town is situated near the centre of the kingdom, in the north west
extremity of the county of Warwick, and so near the verge of it, that
within the distance of one mile and a half from the centre, on the road
to Wolverhampton, a person removes himself into Staffordshire, and on
the road to Alcester, about the same distance from the centre, you are
in the county of Worcester.</p>

<p>The superficial contents of the parish is two thousand, eight hundred,
and sixty-four acres.</p>

<p>The situation of the town is very uneven in its surface, but not in any
part flat; on which account the rains and superfluous water, remove all
obstructions, and contributes in a considerable degree to the salubrity
of the air.</p>

<p>From the remarkable dry foundation of the houses, and the moderate
elevation on which they are erected, the celebrated Dr. Priestley
pronounced the air of this town to be equally pure as any he had
analysed. The water is also allowed by medical practitioners, to be of a
superior quality, and very conducive to the health of the inhabitants,
who are scarcely ever afflicted with epidemic diseases.</p>

<p>The foundation of the houses is, with very few exceptions, a dry mass of
sandy rock, from whence there are not any noxious vapours arise, and on
that account, the cellars might be inhabited with safety, but that is
not customary here.</p>

<p>In approaching the town, you ascend in every direction, except from
Halesowen; on which account the air has free access to every part of it,
and the sun can exercise its full powers in exhaling superfluous
moisture.</p>

<p>In this favoured spot, the inhabitants enjoy four of the greatest
benefits that can attend human existence; air more pure than in many
other places; water of an excellent quality; the genial influence of the
sun; and a situation not in the least subject to damps.</p>

<p>The adjacent lands are of an inferior quality, but by cultivation they
are rendered tolerably productive; those immediately surrounding the
town, are almost in every direction converted into gardens, which are in
general rented from one to two guineas per year, and without a doubt are
very conducive to the health of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The waste lands about the town being inclosed in the year 1800 were
found to contain two hundred and eighty nine acres, which land now lets
from thirty to fifty shillings per acre.</p>

<p>The only stream of water that flows to this town is a small rivulet,
denominated the river Rea, which takes its rise upon Rubery Hill, near
one mile north of Bromsgrove Lickey, about eight miles distant, from
whence there being a considerable descent, numerous reservoirs have been
made, which enables the stream, within that short space, to drive ten
mills, exclusive of two within the town; and what is very remarkable,
some person has erected a windmill very near its banks, where the ground
is not in the least elevated. This curiosity of a windmill being
erected in a valley, is very visible soon after you have passed the
buildings on the road to Bromsgrove.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding there is only one stream of water, the streets are so
intersected by canals, that there is only one entrance into the town
without coming over a bridge, and that is from Worcester.</p>

<p>At the top of Digbeth, very near the church-yard of St. Martin's, there
is a never-failing spring of pure soft water, wherein is affixed what is
called the cock pump; which being free to all the inhabitants, it is a
very common thing to see from twelve to twenty people, each of them with
a pair of large tin buckets, waiting for their turn to fill them, and
this in succession through the whole day. From this very powerful spring
there is a continual stream that runs through the cellars, on each side
of the street, and several of the inhabitants have therein affixed
pumps, from which innumerable water carts are filled every hour of the
day; notwithstanding which, during the greatest heats and droughts,
there is always a super-abundance of that necessary and valuable
article.</p>

<p>Immediately above the same church-yard, and near to the principal
entrance, there is another pump, constructed in such a singular manner,
that I have no hesitation in saying, there never was one of the same
before, nor ever will be in future.</p>

<p><i>LADY WELL.</i></p>

<p>This inexhaustible spring of soft water has for a series of years been
encircled by a brick wall, which forms a very capacious reservoir; from
whence there are at least forty people obtain a livelihood, by conveying
the water in buckets to different parts of the town. An attempt was made
in July, 1818, to prevent the public from having access to this
invaluable water; but by the commissioners of the street acts
interfering, it remains open to the public.</p>

<p>No town in existence can be more plentifully supplied with water than
this is, nor in a more commodious manner, for every respectable house
either has a pump to itself, or one pump to serve two houses; and in
every court, where there are a number of small houses, that useful
appendage is not in any instance wanting, for the accommodation of the
tenants.</p>

<p>In various parts of the town the water is soft, but it is not so in
general; and to supply that defect, numerous people find their advantage
in conveying that useful article in carts, and innumerable others in
carrying it with a yoke and two buckets, to those who are in want of it,
which they sell at the rate of from ten to twelve gallons for one penny,
according to the distance.</p>

<p>Near one mile and a half from the centre of the town, there is, on the
road towards Coleshill, a chalybeate spring, which some years back was
in general repute, but now little attention is paid to it.</p>

<p>The lands in the vicinity of this town are beyond all doubt higher than
any other in the kingdom; there being three instances of springs
issuing from them that take two different courses. One instance is upon
Bromsgrove Lickey, from whence two springs arise, one of which flows
into the Severn, and the other into the Trent.&mdash;Another instance is at
the Quinton, on the road to Halesowen, from whence there issues two
springs, each of them taking the same course as those from Bromsgrove
Lickey. The third is at Corley, in the vicinity of Packington, where
they pursue the same courses. These springs arise in a triangular
direction, Birmingham being in the centre.</p>

<p>To demonstrate what has been advanced respecting the salubrity of the
air and purity of the water, the hotel, in Temple-row, was erected in
the year 1772, upon the tontine principle. There being fifty shares, of
course the same number of lives must be nominated at that time, of whom
there were, in the middle of October, 1818, forty-five still living.</p>

<p>Another instance may be adduced, equally appropriate. There are at the
present time, 1818, still living, and in health, seventeen persons, (and
there may be several more), who all of them received their education
under one schoolmaster, the youngest of whom is sixty-nine years of age.</p>

<p>And what is still more remarkable, although there were in the middle of
November more than three hundred and eighty children in the asylum,
there was not one sick person in that numerous family. </p>

<p><i>ST. MARTIN's CHURCH</i></p>

<p>Is undoubtedly of great antiquity, and to trace its foundation is at
present impossible, tradition itself not giving any clue. It was
originally erected with stone, but the exterior being decayed by time,
in the year 1690 the body of the church, and also the tower, were cased
with bricks of an admirable quality, and mortar suitable to them, for at
this time there is scarcely any symptoms of decay. The elegant spire has
been several times injured by lightning, and during its repairs the
workmen have contracted the length of it considerably. It was at one
time (whatever it is now) the loftiest spire in the kingdom, measuring
from its base to the weathercock. The person who repaired it in 1777
made the observation.&mdash;There are, no doubt, several steeples more lofty,
measuring from the ground, the towers of which extend to a great height,
whilst this at Birmingham is very low.&mdash;There are within the church two
marble monuments, with recumbent figures upon them, but no inscription,
and are, like the church, of such ancient date, that no person has yet
presumed to say when they were executed nor for whom, (only by
conjecture); but let the artists be who they would, the effigies do them
great credit, and were highly deserving of better treatment than they
have experienced. In the church is a fine-toned organ. In the steeple
are twelve musical bells, and a set of chimes, that play with great
accuracy a different tune every day in the week, at the hour of three,
six, nine and twelve; and they are so contrived, that they shift from
one tune to another, by means of their own machinery. On the south side
of the tower there is a meridian line, which was affixed there by
Ferguson, the astronomer, so that when the sun shines, the hour of
twelve may be ascertained to a certainty. Birmingham is only one parish,
except for church fees, and in that respect, the rector of St. Philip's
presides over a small part within the town. The Rev. Charles Curtis is
rector of Birmingham: the Rev. Edmund Outram being rector of St.
Philip's, in Birmingham. The regimental colours, late belonging to the
Loyal Birmingham Association, are suspended in the east window, over the
altar. This church is computed to accommodate 2200 persons.</p>

<br>

<p><i>ST. PHILIP's CHURCH.</i></p>

<p>The scite of the church-yard, parsonage, and blue-coat school was the
gift of Mrs. Elizabeth Phillips, and her son and daughter in law, Mr.
and Mrs. William Inge, the ancestors of William Phillips Inge, Esq.
without stipulating for the presentation. This superb edifice was
designed in the year 1710, by Thomas Archer, Esq.<a name="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> who was gentleman
of the bed chamber to her majesty Queen Anne, and who, it is universally
allowed by all who have taken particular notice of this building, was
possessed of superior abilities, and a refined taste as an architect.
An act of parliament being obtained for the erection of it in the year
1709, the same was begun in 1711, under a commission, granted to twenty
of the neighbouring gentry, who were appointed by the bishop of the
diocese, under his episcopal seal; whose commission was to expire twelve
months after the church should be erected. It was consecrated in the
year 1715, but not finished till 1719, when the commissioners resigned
their authority into the hands of the diocesan, in whom the presentation
rests.</p>

<a name="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor3">[3]</a><div class=note> He also designed the church of St. John, in Westminster.</div><br>

<p>The money expended by the commissioners, two years after the
consecration, did not amount to quite &pound;5000; but then it must be
recollected, that a very large proportion of the materials were given,
and conveyed to the spot free of expence. A considerable sum of money
being left unpaid; this circumstance was made known to his majesty,
George Ist, by the intercession of Sir Richard Gough, when he, in 1725,
generously contributed six hundred pounds towards the completion of it;
and the inhabitants, to express their gratitude for this favour, affixed
the crest of Sir Richard Gough, as a vane, on the top of it.</p>

<p>The urns upon the parapet of the church, which contribute in a
considerable degree to its appearance, were placed there when the
celebrated Baskerville was church-warden, in the year 1750. The organ
posseses full tone and great power; the paintings, mouldings, and
gildings are superb, and do great credit to those who were employed.
Under the centre of the church there is a capacious vault, which extends
the whole length of it. The dome in some degree resembles that of St.
Paul's, in London, and in the tower underneath it are ten musical
bells, and a set of chimes that play a different tune every day in the
week, at the hours of one, four, seven, and ten; which tunes shift of
themselves by means of the machinery. On the south side of the tower
there is a meridian line affixed, by means of which, if the sun shines,
the hour of twelve is known to a certainty. This elegant pile of
building has been examined with the greatest minuteness, by numerous
architects, both within and without, and by all of them declared to be
the work of a master; it being equally convenient as it is elegant. The
church-yard, by which it is surrounded, corresponds with the building;
its area contains four acres of ground, wherein are numerous gravel
walks, ornamented with double rows of lime trees, which during summer
form shady walks, and being surrounded with excellent buildings, it
represents such a scene as probably cannot be surpassed in Europe. The
parsonage-house is at the south east corner of the church-yard, where
the present rector, the Rev. Edmund Outram, D.D. resides. This church is
calculated to accommodate 2000 auditors.&mdash;At the north east corner is a
spacious building, with a stone front, which is a charity school,
wherein there are at this time one hundred and eight boys and fifty-four
girls, receiving their education.&mdash;(<i>See Blue Coat School.</i>)</p>
<br>

<p><i>CHRIST CHURCH.</i></p>

<p>The land whereon this edifice is erected was the gift of William
Phillips Inge, Esq. whose ancestors about a century ago generously gave
the scite upon which the church of St. Philip's stands. It is situated
at the upper end of New-street, and the first stone of it was intended
to have been laid by his present majesty, George the 3d, in person; but
it having pleased the Almighty to afflict him with indisposition, that
ceremony was performed by the Earl of Dartmouth, on the 22d of July,
1805, in presence of the bishop of the diocese, who was attended by
numbers of the nobility, clergy, gentry, the trustees appointed under
the act of parliament, and a numerous assemblage of the inhabitants.
Although his majesty's malady did not admit of his being present upon
this occasion, as it is understood he very much wished to be, he in a
very condescending manner gave directions for the payment of one
thousand pounds, from his private purse, towards the completion of the
building. The body of the church being free to all description of
persons, is fitted up with benches for their accommodation; but rent
being paid to the clergyman for kneelings in the galleries, they are
finished in a style of elegance, with mahogany, supported by light
pillars of the doric order. The church was consecrated with great
solemnity on the 13th of July, 1813, by the Honourable and Right Rev.
James Cornwallis, bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, and an appropriate
sermon preached by the Rev. Edmund Outram, D.D. the worthy rector of St.
Philip's church, who selected his text from one of the beatitudes&mdash;&quot;<i>The
poor have the gospel preached unto them.</i>&quot;&mdash;The bishop, in whom the
presentation rests, afterwards gave to the Rev. J. Hume Spry, whom he
had appointed to the living, the sum of one hundred pounds, to purchase
bibles and prayer books, for the use of the congregation, or that part
of it whom he perceived to be the most regular in their attendance.
Divine service was first performed by the aforesaid clergyman, on Sunday
the 18th of July, at half past ten o'clock in the morning, and in the
evening at six o'clock. The ascent to the galleries is by a double
geometrical staircase, of stone, with ballustrades of iron, coated with
brass, which appear light and produces an elegant effect; these, with
the railing at the altar, were an entire new manufacture, invented by
Mr. B. Cooke, whose manufactory is carried on at Baskerville House. The
altar piece, designed by Mr. Stock, of Bristol, is of mahogany, above
which is a painting by Mr. Barber, representing a cross, apparently in
the clouds. These being completed in June, 1815, an elegant
well-finished organ, built by Elliott, of London, was erected about the
same time; and is considered to be one of the most powerful and
well-arranged instruments in this part of the kingdom. The present
organist is Mr. Munden. The portico and spire were both of them erected
by Mr. Richardson, of Handsworth; the former at the expense of &pound;1200 and
the latter &pound;1500, which was completed in 1816. In the year 1817, a clock
was affixed in the tower, by Mr. Allport, which has four dials, and each
of them both hour and minute hands. This place of worship is computed to
accommodate 1500 hearers.</p>

<p>Isaac Hawkins Brown, Esq. the late worthy representative for Bridgnorth,
who had on several occasions rendered his powerful services to this
town, being co-trustee with the Rev. Thomas Gisborne, under the will of
Isaac Hawkins, Esq. they had considerable sums of money at their
disposal, for benevolent purposes, and out of those funds he proposed to
appropriate the sum of one thousand pounds towards the erection of a
free church in Birmingham.</p>

<p>In consequence of this liberal suggestion, a town's meeting was
convened, whereat it was unanimously resolved to petition parliament on
the subject, under sanction of the bishop of the diocese, who in the
most handsome manner proposed to annex the prebendary of Tachbrooke, in
aid of the said benefice. A liberal subscription immediately commenced
among the inhabitants, who were most powerfully assisted with large sums
contributed by the nobility and gentry, resident in the vicinity.
Considerably more expenses being incurred during the erection of the
building than what had been calculated upon, it was considered necessary
to make a second application to parliament, to empower the trustees to
convert the arches under the church into catacombs, under the idea that
they would be readily disposed of at the rate of four pounds each; the
trustees purchasing one third of them. In this calculation they have
been very much disappointed, there having as yet only two corpse been
interred there; but it is presumed, that when the inhabitants are
familiarised to that mode of sepulture, they will prefer them to the
present custom of erecting vaults, which are attended with considerably
more expense.</p>

<p>The erection of this free church confers great credit on the town, as
the want of such accommodation was very apparent, from the increased
population; and this is manifest by its being so well attended; the
congregation being considerably more numerous than can be accommodated,
and they express their satisfaction by decent and orderly behaviour.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>ST. BARTHOLOMEW's CHAPEL.</i></span><br>

<p>The land whereon this chapel is erected was the gift of John Jennens,
Esq. who possessed a considerable estate in and near this town. It was
erected in the year 1749, in the centre of an extensive burial ground,
and is fitted up in a very neat and commodious manner. Mrs. Jennens
contributed towards its erection the sum of one thousand pounds, and the
remainder was raised by subscription. The altar piece was the gift of
Basil, Earl of Denbigh, and the communion plate, consisting of 182
ounces, that of Mary Careles. There has since been erected a fine-toned
organ. The present chaplain is the Rev. Charles Warneford. This chapel
is calculated to accommodate 800 auditors.</p>
<br>

<p><i>ST. MARY'S CHAPEL.</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Weaman being possessed of some land at that time on the outside of
the town, made a present of the ground whereon it is built, reserving to
herself the presentation. It was erected in the year 1774, in an octagon
form, and being very spacious, the diminutive steeple attached to it, is
not by any means proportionate. The present incumbent is the Rev. Edward
Burn, A. M.&mdash;This place of worship is computed to accommodate 2000
hearers.</p>
<br>

<p><i>ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL.</i></p>

<p>This elegant pile of building was erected in the year 1779, upon land
the gift of Charles Colmore, Esq. reserving to himself the presentation.
The ground whereon it stands being a declivity, is not altogether
suitable for such a pile of building, but at that time it was the most
eligible spot at his disposal. The attendants upon this place of worship
raised a subscription, and in the year 1791 caused a beautiful window of
stained glass to be placed over the communion table, representing the
conversion of St. Paul; by that ingenious artist Francis Eginton; price
four hundred guineas. Although the inside is thus ornamented, the
steeple remains to be erected, it being at present only delineated upon
paper. The present incumbent is the Rev. Rann Kennedy. This chapel is
calculated to accommodate 1130 persons.</p>
<br>

<p><i>ST. JOHN'S CHAPEL, DERITEND</i></p>

<p>Was originally founded in 1382, during the reign of Richard 2d. This
place of worship, which is a chapel of ease to the parish of Aston,
appears to have been erected in the year 1735, and to which the tower
was added in 1762, wherein eight musical bells and a clock were affixed
in 1777. The perpetual curate is the Rev. John Darwall, A.M. This chapel
is calculated to accommodate 700 persons.</p>
<br>

<p><i>ST. JAMES'S CHAPEL, ASHSTED.</i></p>

<p>This structure was erected by an eminent physician, John Ash, M.D. for
his own residence, but before the building was completed, he went to
reside in London; and having disposed of this property to Mr. John
Brooke, he converted it into a place of worship, which was consecrated
in the year 1810. Minister, the Rev. Edward Burn, A.M. This place of
worship is capable of containing 1200 auditors.&mdash;N.B. The two last are
in the parish of Aston.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Burial Ground.</i></p>

<p>The different cemeteries within the town being crowded with the bodies
of the deceased, it was considered proper to purchase three acres of
land near to the chapel of St. Bartholomew, as an additional burying
ground; for which the sum of &pound;1600 was paid to the governors of the Free
School. This ground is divided into two parts, each of which is inclosed
by a brick wall, surmounted by iron palisadoes, and gates of the same at
the entrance, which are secured by locks. It was consecrated on the 6th
of July, 1813, by the bishop of the diocese.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Births and Burials.</i></p>

<p>It will undoubtedly be expected that something should be said under this
head, but the different sectaries, who never come near the church upon
either occasion, are so numeorous, that nothing like a regular estimate
can be made.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Chapel in Broad-street,</i></p>

<p>FOR CATHOLICS.</p>

<p>The religious of this persuasion erected a place of worship in the year
1789, which was considerably improved in 1800; it is situated in
Broad-street, and fitted up in a commodious manner, with an organ. They
have also another chapel in Shadwell-street.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Meeting in Bull-street,</i></p>

<p>FOR THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS.</p>

<p>This pile of building, although destitute of ornaments has a very
respectable appearance, and the inside of it is fitted up in a very
appropriate manner. There is at the back of it an extensive cemetery,
and another small one in Monmouth-street.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Old Meeting,</i></p>

<p>FOR PROTESTANT DISSENTERS.</p>

<p>This substantial and well-constructed pile of building, particularly the
roof, was erected about the year 1793; the old one, which gave name to
the street, having been destroyed by fire in 1791. Had this meeting been
erected in a more spacious street, it might have been seen to advantage,
but its beauties are here lost. The interior is fitted up to correspond
with the exterior, and therein is affixed a fine-toned organ. The
officiating ministers are the Rev. R. Kell and the Rev. John Corrie.
There is a spacious burial ground attached to this meeting.</p>
<br>

<p><i>New Meeting,</i></p>

<p>FOR PROTESTANT DISSENTERS.</p>

<p>This substantial edifice, being cased with stone, fronts towards
Moor-street; the former erection, which gave name to the street, being
destroyed by fire in 1791. This, like the old meeting, is fitted up in
a neat and convenient manner, in every respect, being furnished with an
organ suitable to the size of the building. The Rev. John Kentish and
the Rev. James Yates are the ministers.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Meeting in Carres Lane,</i></p>

<p>FOR CALVINISTS.</p>

<p>This is a neat and commodious pile of building, in every respect
suitable for the purpose intended.&mdash;In Livery-street the Calvinists
converted a riding-school into a place of worship, which is commodiously
fitted up and will hold a numerous congregation.</p>

<p>This religious society have another place of worship in
Bartholomew-street, and have lately completed a fourth, upon a very
extensive scale, in Steelhouse-lane, which was opened for divine service
on the 9th of Dec. 1818. It is fitted up with pews, capable of
containing 2000 auditors, and is lighted by means of gas, in the most
superb manner. A scion from this meeting has lately fitted up a
warehouse in Bristol-street, as a place of worship.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Meeting in Cherry-street,</i></p>

<p>FOR METHODISTS.</p>

<p>This building was erected in the year 1782, and opened as a place of
worship by the celebrated John Wesley, it being fitted up in a
commodious manner for the purpose.</p>

<p>This sect has increased in a surprising manner; they having since
erected one extensive meeting in Belmont-row, another in
Bradford-street, and a fourth in Oxford-street.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Meeting in Cannon-street,</i>  FOR PARTICULAR BAPTISTS.</p>

<p>This extensive and well-arranged pile of building was erected in the
year 1804; and at the back of it is a school upon a large scale, for the
youth of that persuasion.</p>

<p>This society have become so numerous, that they possess a meeting upon
an extensive scale in Newhall-street, and another in Bond-street. There
is also a meeting for general baptists in Lombard-street, Deritend.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Meeting in King-street,</i></p>

<p>FOR THE FOLLOWERS OF LADY HUNTINGDON.</p>

<p>This place of religious worship was originally a theatre; where some of
the most celebrated performers have made their appearance; but it has
for several years been appropriated to the performance of divine
service, being fitted up in a commodious manner for that purpose.</p>
<br>

<p><i>New Jerusalem Temple,</i></p>

<p>FOR SWEDENBURGIANS.</p>

<p>This small place of worship is situated in Newhall-street, directly
opposite the coal wharf, and is fitted up for the accommodation of those
who embrace the tenets of Swedenburg.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Synagogue</i>,</p>

<p>FOR THE JEWS.</p>

<p>The Israelites having from some cause abandoned their ancient place of
worship, have erected another suitable for their devotion, which is
finished in a neat manner, and makes a respectable appearance, in
Severn-street, near the Lancasterian School.</p>

<p>In this town every individual worships his maker in whatever way his
inclination leads him, without the least notice being taken or remarks
made; if a person's conduct is exemplary, or if he does not give way to
any vicious propensities, no one will interrupt or interfere with him.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Lench's Trust.</i></p>

<p>In the time of Henry the 8th, an inhabitant, named William Lench,
bequeathed some land, which is vested in sixteen trustees, for the
purpose of keeping the streets within a certain district in repair, and
to erect almshouses, which the trustees have complied with, there being
twelve of that description erected by them at the bottom of
Steelhouse-lane, for the benefit and residence of the same number of
aged people. There are nine others in Dudley-street, and four in
Park-street, wherein fifty-two aged females reside. The present rental
is about &pound;600 per ann.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Fentham's Trust.</i></p>

<p>In the year 1712,&mdash;Fentham bequeathed &pound;100 per annum to teach poor
children to read, and for cloathing ten poor widows of Birmingham. The
children educated by this trust, are maintained and educated in the blue
coat charity school, being for distinction sake cloathed in green.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Crowley's Trust.</i></p>

<p>In the year 1733, Mrs. Crowley left six houses in trust; the rents of
which were to support ten girls, who are also in the same school.</p>
<br>

<p>PRIVATE CHARITIES.</p>

<p><i>Society for cloathing destitute Women and Children.</i></p>

<p>In the year 1800, a few ladies impressed with benevolent ideas
associated together, and formed a society for the above purpose: the
subscriptions were fixed at three shillings and five shillings per
quarter; the former to distribute five shillings and the latter seven
shillings, in articles of cloathing.</p>

<p>There have in general been from ninety to one hundred and ten
subscribers, who have annually relieved near four hundred persons, by
accommodating them with comfortable cloathing, by the aggregate sum
arising from these small contributions.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this very slight sketch of the institution may induce
many others to unite in this most beneficial mode of relieving the poor.
Subscriptions and donations for this charity are received at Mr.
Cadbury's, in Bull-street.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Female Benevolent Society.</i></p>

<p>This highly commendable institution was established in the year 1802,
for the purpose of relieving indigent married women when they are
confined by reason of child-birth, or other infirmities. Two visitors
are appointed, who examine into every person's situation that applies
for assistance, and they administer such relief as the nature of the
case seems to require. A subscriber of three shillings per quarter, may,
if they think proper, recommend one object to receive five shillings,
and a subscriber of six shillings, two objects, who may each of them
receive five shillings, or one woman when she lies in may receive ten
shillings, or one poor widow or sick person may receive nine-pence per
week during the quarter. In the first nine years of this establishment,
the sum of &pound;417. 16s. was distributed among sick and indigent females,
and since that time the society has been upon the increase, but no
report has been printed. Subscriptions and donations for this charity
will be received by Mrs. Dickenson, Summer-hill.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Depositing Society</i></p>

<p>Have for their object, to improve the condition of the poor, by inciting
them to diligence and habits of economy; encouraging them to deposit any
sum of money weekly with a committee of ladies, who allow small premiums
upon every shilling that is deposited with them. Their view is, to
enable the poor to discharge debts, redeem pledges, purchase coals,
cloathing, bedding, etc. The last printed report states, that from the
1st of January, 1815, to Midsummer, 1816, the deposits amounted to &pound;538.
11s. 6d. and that the sum of &pound;120. 3s. 2d. had been paid in premiums to
189 poor persons, making in the whole the sum of &pound;658. 14s. 8d. By this
statement it appears that the poor were benefited more than 22 per cent,
on their deposits, which is undoubtedly very great encouragement.
Subscriptions and benefactions in aid of this society will be received
by Mr. J. Dickenson, treasurer, Summer-hill. This society appears to
have been established fifteen years.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Institution for providing Nurses for poor married Women, when lying
in.</i>  This laudable society of ladies originated in the year 1814, and
since its establishment more than 700 persons have by their means been
attended to, in a comfortable manner; their assistance having been
extended to 129 objects of charity during the last year, and to 77 of
them money has been distributed.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Institution for providing Clothes for new-born Infants.</i></p>

<p>The object of this society is to raise a fund, and to purchase linen,
flannel, etc. which the ladies make into suitable cloathing for the
intended purpose. Each subscriber of two shillings and six-pence
annually, may recommend one object to receive a suit of cloathing, and
in proportion for a larger sum.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Lying-in Charity at the Five Ways.</i></p>

<p>This is supported entirely by voluntary contribution and liberal
donations; several of its contributors, much to their honour, having in
a benevolent manner assisted the charity by their industry in making
different articles with their own hands. Its object is to supply poor
married women with linen, during the time they are confined from
child-birth, and also to furnish them with a set of linen for the
infant. They are at the same time presented with two shillings and
six-pence towards paying the midwife.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Deritend and Bordesley Society for assisting the sick</i> <i>Poor with clean
Linen.</i></p>

<p>This charity was instituted in the year 1806, and is conducted by a
committee, consisting of six visitors, a treasurer, and a store-keeper.
Any person wanting relief must procure a note, and deliver it to one of
the visitors, who having seen the sick person, gives an order for such
linen as appears necessary, and this they retain so long as the visitor
thinks they have occasion for it; and when requisite, the house is
cleaned, and money given for their support.</p>

<p>If the stock of linen will admit of it, women are accommodated for the
space of one month, whilst they are lying-in. Since this society was
first instituted, more than nine hundred poor persons have derived
benefit from it, within the limited district of Deritend and Bordesley.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Sick Society, Cannon-street</i>.</p>

<p>This society has been established for a series of years, for the weekly
visiting, relieving, and instructing the sick poor, of every
denomination; about three hundred of whom are visited and relieved by
this society annually.</p>

<p>A society was established about seven years back, and is still
continued, for lending blankets to poor people during the winter season.</p>

<p>At St. Mary's chapel there is a benevolent society, for relieving the
indigent sick; and the congregation have likewise established a school
of industry, for females, which is supported by voluntary subscription.</p>

<p>The editor is given to understand, that every religious society in the
town has a charitable institution belonging to it, that are each of them
confined to their own congregation. There is an Auxiliary Bible Society
and also a branch of the Missionary Society.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>The Free Grammar School</i></span><br>

<p>Was founded by King Edward 6th, in the fifth year of his reign, and
endowed with lands, which, by the increased value of such property, now
produce more than two thousand pounds per annum. The present building
was erected in the year 1707, and is well adapted for the intended
purpose.</p>

<p>This seminary has the privilege of sending ten exhibitioners to the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, who are each of them allowed
thirty-five pounds per annum, for the space of seven years.</p>

<p>The management of these revenues is vested in twenty governors, who
annually, from their own body, select a bailiff; and when any governor
dies, they are empowered to elect another to supply his place. In the
centre of the building there is a small tower, with a whole-length
figure of the founder. This school is regulated by a chief master, who
receives a liberal salary, a second master, and two ushers, who are
assisted by a person to teach writing and another to instruct the pupils
in drawing. The present head master is the Rev. John Cooke. There is
also a librarian. In the large room there is an elegant marble bust of
the founder, by Scheemaker, which is much admired for its sculpture.</p>

<p>The governors of this school support one extensive preparatory school in
Shut-lane, and there are four others for boys, to each of which there
are two sets of pupils: one of them attends by day and the other in the
evening. There are also two others for girls.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Blue Coat School</i></p>

<p>Is situated in St. Philip's church-yard: it was erected in the year
1724, but considerably enlarged in 1794, at the expense of &pound;2800. It
possesses an annual income of &pound;700, and therein are educated,
maintained, and cloathed 108 boys and 54 girls, in the arts of reading,
writing, arithmetic, sewing, knitting, etc. In front of this building
there are two statues, a boy and a girl, in the habit of the school;
they were executed by a statuary of this town, named Grubb, and do him
infinite credit, for they would not disgrace a Roman artist. Adjoining
to the school there is a spacious area, for the amusement and recreation
of the boys, and a separate one for the girls. The inhabitants subscribe
liberally towards its support, and every six months, sermons are
preached at all the places of worship upon the establishment, and
afterwards there is always a collection, to which many people contribute
in a very liberal manner. To this institution some considerable legacies
have been bequeathed; and in the year 1795, the lord of the manor
granted a lease for 999 years, of four acres of land upon Birmingham
Heath, at one shilling per annum, for its benefit.&mdash;Persons desirous of
viewing the interior of the premises may be accommodated upon making
application to the master, Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>It appears by the printed accounts of this school, published in the
year 1817, that some young men, who received their education there, have
formed an association, under the title of <i>'True Blues,'</i> each of whom
contributes a weekly sum towards the parent institution, and that the
trustees have received at different times from this association the sum
of one hundred and fifteen pounds and three-pence.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Protestant Dissenters' Charity School</i></p>

<p>Is situated in Park street, commodious premises having been purchased
for that purpose. In this school females only are admitted, to the
number of thirty-six, who are maintained, cloathed, and educated, by
voluntary subscription, and collections made after sermons, which are
preached annually at the old and new meeting houses.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The National School</i></p>

<p>Is situated in Pinfold-street, where a substantial pile of building was
erected in the year 1813, capable of containing on the ground floor,
five hundred boys, and on the upper story, four hundred girls. This
seminary is only intended for the instruction of those children who are
brought up according to the established religion, and is conducted upon
the Madras system, originally invented by Dr. Bell. This building is
inclosed by a lofty brick wall, within which there is vacant ground for
the recreation of boys and girls separately. This institution is under
the management of Mr. Martin for the boys, and Mrs. Chawner for the
girls. Since the institution of this school, 1906 boys and about 1000
girls have received instruction.</p>



<p><i>The Royal Lancasterian Free School</i></p>

<p>Was erected in Severn-street in the year 1809, where boys of all
denominations are instructed in reading, writing, and accounts. The room
is calculated to accommodate four hundred pupils, and since its erection
1800 have derived the benefit of education. In this seminary visitors
are uniformly received with kindness, and respectfully informed of any
particulars they may think proper to enquire after, by the master, Mr.
Thomas Baker. An examination taking place every Saturday, no visitors
are admitted on that day between the hours of ten and twelve; but at any
other time, the school is open for inspection during school hours.
During the year 1818, 215 boys left the school, having been instructed
in reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>

<p>Upon a similar plan there is a school established for the instruction of
females, which is situated in Park-street.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Sunday Schools.</i></p>

<p>These institutions are exceedingly numerous, in every part of the town,
and not only so, but they are remarkably well attended to, by those of
the established religion; and each denomination of dissenters endeavours
to out-vie the other in these establishments. The children are all of
them neatly cloathed of a Sunday, numbers of them by contributing one
penny per week to that purpose, which with donations that are made,
effectually answers the end proposed. </p>

<p><i>The General Hospital.</i></p>

<p>The exterior of this substantial building was erected in the year 1766
under the superintendance of an eminent physician, John Ash, M.D. but
for want of funds, it lay dormant for the space of twelve years; when,
in 1778, some well-disposed people stepped forward, and solicited
subscriptions in so earnest a manner, that during the next year the
hospital was prepared to receive patients, and during the first nine
months there was admitted,</p>

<p>IN-PATIENTS.</p>

<p>Discharged cured .. .. .. 135</p>

<p>Remained on the books .. .. .. 71</p>

<p>By this statement it is evident that the faculty exerted their skill,
and exercised their humanity, by giving their attendance gratis.  In a
few years, the patients became so numerous, that in 1790 it was
considered necessary to add two wings to the building. It is supported
by voluntary subscription, and once in three years a music meeting is
held, from which it derives unprecedented advantage. At the meeting
which took place in 1817, the gross receipts, during the three days'
performance, amounted to the sum of &pound;8476. 6s. 9d., of which the
treasurers of the hospital received the sum of &pound;4290. 10s. 10d.; there
not being an instance upon record of any institution receiving so much
benefit, or such extensive patronage, from a similar source. A list of
the donations and benefactions are recorded in the hall, which enable
the committee to extend relief to numerous individuals, who otherwise
might perish for want of medical assistance.</p>

<p>In the year ending Midsummer 1818, there were relieved 1167 in-patients
and 2541 out-patients, including 766 for the cow-pock, who all of them
did well. The under-mentioned physicians and surgeons attend
gratuitously, and give their advice and assistance in the most humane
manner; it being impossible to enumerate any place where greater
attention and humanity are practised.</p>

<p><i>The Dispensary.</i></p>

<p>This laudable institution originated among a select society, and was
carried on in a private manner for some time; until they were joined by
the late Matthew Boulton, Esq. who took it under his patronage in the
year 1793, when a house was taken in Temple-row, and an establishment
formed; he taking upon himself the office of treasurer, saying, &quot;if the
funds of the institution are not sufficient for its support, I will make
up the deficiency.&quot; It continued in Temple-row, supported by voluntary
subscriptions and donations, until the year 1808, when a commodious
building having been erected for the purpose, in Union-street, at the
expense of more than two thousand pounds, the establishment, consisting
of a house apothecary, another for the compounding and dispensing of the
medicines, and a midwife, removed there. Those who have previously
received a recommendation, are here accommodated with medical advice and
assistance, gratis, and the females in the time of need are attended at
their own dwellings by the midwife, as are also sick patients, who are
too ill to attend personally. Since this dispensary was first
established, there have been 37139 sick patients, 6223 midwifery, and
13964 persons inoculated in the vaccine manner, at the expense of the
institution; of whom 2523 sick, 387 midwifery, and 434 vaccine
inoculation, were attended to during the last year, ending Michaelmas,
1818; the subscriptions amounting to &pound;599 11s.</p>

<p><i>The Workhouse.</i></p>

<p>This extensive establishment for the accommodation of the poor, is
situated in Lichfield-street, and is under the management of twelve
overseers; six of whom are made choice of at Lady-day and the other six
at Michaelmas; so that there are always some in office, who having been
initiated, understand the rules and customs of the house. In addition to
the overseers, there are one hundred and eight guardians, elected by the
inhabitants who pay levies, and they continue in office for three years,
during which time they possess all the power and authority of overseers,
except making and collecting of rates, from both of which they are
exempt, nor can they be compelled to assist therein as guardians; but
the serving of this office does not excuse them from being chosen into
any other.</p>

<p>The church-wardens and overseers for the time being are guardians by
virtue of their office; and at the expiration of the year, they may
continue to act as such, or not, at their option. The appointment of
treasurers, clerks, governors, and other officers, with their servants,
is vested in the guardians; who are required to keep regular accounts of
their proceedings, which must be signed by the chairman at every meeting
they hold. All fines, forfeitures, and other public monies are required
to be paid into the hands of the guardians, whose duty it is to meet
every week, and also after every quarter-day.</p>

<p>In the year 1816, trade being at a very low ebb, the applications for
relief were so very numerous, that in order to support this
establishment, between Michaelmas in that year and the same time in
1817, it was necessary to collect thirty-six levies, which produced the
astonishing sum of sixty thousand two hundred and fourteen pounds,
seventeen shillings, and six-pence. From Michaelmas, 1817, to the same
time in 1818, there was twenty-eight levies, which produced the sum of
fifty-one thousand nine hundred and forty-three pounds, nine shillings,
and nine pence halfpenny.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Asylum for the Infant Poor belonging to the Parish of</i> <i>Birmingham</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 1797 the overseers and guardians being convinced of the
evils that arose from the system then pursued, of placing the children
out at nurse, in the vicinity of the town, formed the resolution of
taking certain premises situated in Summer-lane, where all the children
might be properly attended to and taken care of.</p>

<p>This being done, a committee of overseers and guardians were appointed
to superintend the institution: they being made choice of annually, meet
every Monday for the purpose of examining the demands on the asylum
drawing cheques for the amount of the bills on the cashier of the
workhouse, and inspecting the state of the institution.</p>

<p>The average number of children who have been maintained, cloathed, and
educated, for the last twelve months, has been three hundred and eighty;
of whom three hundred are employed in manufacturing of pins, straw plat,
and lace.  The produce of the children's labour since the institution
was established, has been progressively accumulating, and that to such a
degree, that the committee have been enabled to purchase the premises
they inhabit, with about two acres of land, which with the additional
buildings and improvements, are now worth nearly six thousand pounds,
and are the property of the parish.</p>

<p>The whole of this information is very interesting, but what follows is
highly deserving of attention. This account was written at the asylum,
in the middle of November, 1818, when there was not in this numerous
family one sick person.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Philosophical Society.</i></p>

<p>This institution is indebted for its origin to a few scientific
inhabitants, who held a meeting in the year 1800, and having disclosed
their ideas to others, they afterwards formed themselves into a society,
who having engaged premises and procured proper apparatus, devoted a
considerable portion of their time to experimental philosophy;
occasionally delivering lectures among their own members. This being
carried on as a private society for several years, continually
increasing in numbers, they in the year 1813 purchased commodious
premises in Cannon-street, which they fitted up in a similar manner to
the Royal Institution in London, and it is now become a most valuable
establishment. The various lectures that have been delivered by the
different fellows of this society, on mechanism, chemistry, mineralogy,
and metallurgy, have produced very beneficial effects, and contributed
in a considerable degree to the improvement of gilding, plating,
bronzing, vitrification, and metallurgic combinations. At one of these
lectures, in the year 1812, Dr. De Lys descanted upon the advantages an
unfortunate class of society (the deaf and dumb) might derive, if they
were put under proper management; and to elucidate the subject, he
introduced a girl, about eight years of age, who, labouring under those
defects, he and his friend Mr. A. Blair, had been very attentive
to,&mdash;she, being in other respects endowed with an excellent capacity,
paid great attention to what was going forward, and with promptness
executed, or rather anticipated, the wishes of her instructors, which
proved a very animating and affecting spectacle. This circumstance gave
rise to
<i>A General Institution for the Instruction of Deaf and</i>
<i>Dumb Children.</i></p>
<br>

<p>A few days after this girl had been brought forward, a private meeting
took place, when it was determined to establish an institution, under
the above title.</p>

<p>On the 4th of December, 1812, a general meeting was held, and a
committee appointed, who, after making numerous enquiries to find a
person properly qualified to superintend the concern, did at length fix
upon Mr. Thomas Braidwood, who at that time conducted a private school
of the same description, at Hackney; he being initiated in the mystery
by his father and grandfather.</p>

<p>When the plan of this institution was made known to the grand jury at
the summer assizes for the county of Warwick, in the year 1813, it was
universally patronized by them; and when the magistrates, and other
leading characters in the county of Stafford, were apprised of it, they,
with the greatest liberality, gave it their support, as did the Earl of
Plymouth, and other persons of high consideration in the counties of
Worcester, Salop, and Derby.</p>

<p>On the 11th of January, 1814, the school was opened, with a few
children, as day scholars, and a short time after, the number was
increased to fifteen; three of whom came from a distance, and were
provided for, free of any expense to the institution, which was at that
time held in the town. Lord Calthorpe having erected some building at
Edgbaston, in a delightful situation, on an eminence, that commands a
view of Birmingham and the adjacent country for some distance, he, at
the suggestion of Dr. Edward Johnstone, granted an advantageous lease of
it, together with some surrounding land, for the use of this
institution.</p>

<p>At the anniversary which took place on the 29th August, 1814, his Grace
the Duke of Devonshire, as president of this institution, attended in
person, when the committee announced, that every annual subscriber of
one guinea, and every donor of ten pounds are entitled by lot to
nominate a child into this institution, and that the sum of four
shillings per week be required with every child, for lodging,
maintenance, and instruction in the asylum.&mdash;At the anniversary held on
the 4th of August, 1815, the committee made a report, that the asylum
was opened on the 4th of January last, and that twenty children had been
admitted, to which number they recommended the subscribers to ballot
for the admission of eleven others, the funds being adequate to support
that number, with the four shillings per week.</p>

<p>At the anniversary held on the 16th of August, 1816, the committee
recommended a ballot for six additional boys, and proposed to reduce the
weekly sum paid with each pupil from four to three shillings.</p>

<p>In the year 1817, no circumstance took place deserving of notice, but at
the anniversary in 1818 the Marquis of Anglesea presided, and there were
four additional pupils admitted. The whole number in the asylum at the
present time being thirty-two, several of whom have made great
proficiency in drawing.</p>
<br>

<p><i>General Institution for the Relief of Persons labouring under bodily
Deformity.</i></p>

<p>This institution, which is supported by voluntary contributions, was
established in New-street on the 24th of June, 1817, under patronage of
the Earl of Dartmouth, and during the first year of its establishment,
235 patients were relieved, under the care of Mr. John Felton.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Magistrates</i>.</p>

<p>The county magistrates who act for this town, some of whom attend at the
public office, in Moor-street, every Monday and Thursday, are the Rev.
Dr. Spencer, of Aston; William Villers, Esq. of Moseley; George Simcox
and Theodore Price, Esqrs. of Harborne; Wm. Withering, Esq. of the
Larches; William Bedford, Esq. of Birch's Green; William Hamper, Esq.
Deritend House; Edmund Outram, D.D. St. Philip's Parsonage; and Isaac
Spooner, Esq. of Witton.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Public Office</i></p>

<p>Is a neat stone-fronted building, erected in the year 1806, at the
expense of &pound;9000, in Moor-street; the ground floor of which is
appropriated to the use of the commissioners of the street acts, and on
the upper floor, the magistrates transact the public business of the
town, for which purpose some of them attend every Monday and Thursday.
At other times, when it is requisite to convene a public meeting of the
inhabitants, it is made use of for that purpose. Behind this building
there are apartments for the prison-keeper and his attendants, also.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Prison.</i></p>

<p>Which is a spacious building, with a commodious well-paved yard, for the
accommodation of those unfortunates who are therein confined; it being
divided into two parts by a lofty brick wall, for the purpose of
separating the male from the female prisoners, who have each of them
their separate apartments during the day, and at night they are secured
in distinct cells.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Prison, in Bordesley.</i></p>

<p>This being a licensed public house, numerous objections may be made to
it; but under the superintendance of that humane magistrate, William
Hamper, Esq. every accommodation and convenience that the place will
admit of is appropriated to the benefit of those who are there confined,
consistent with their security.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Court Leet.</i></p>

<p>In the latter end of October, a court leet is held for the lord of the
manor, when the low bailiff summonses a jury, and the annual officers
are appointed by them: the low bailiff, in whom all the power is vested;
the high bailiff, whose duty it is to see that justice is done between
buyer and seller, by rectifying the weights and dry measures; two
constables; one headborough, who, if he thinks proper to be vigilant,
can act as constable; but if either of them are in town, he is not
compelled to act; two high tasters, who should examine into the quality
of the ale and its measures; two low tasters, or meat conners, whose
duty it is to examine all meat brought to market, and if any that is
unwholesome is exposed to sale, they are to destroy it; two affeirers,
who ratify the rent and amercements between the lord and his tenants;
and two nominal officers, under the title of leather sealers, who have
no business to attend to, except a good dinner twice a year.</p>

<p>Deritend being a hamlet of Birmingham, its inhabitants attend this court
leet, where a constable being elected for them, he and the officers for
the town are all sworn, in the name of the lord of the manor. The
constables of Birmingham are empowered to act in Deritend, but the
constable of Deritend cannot act in Birmingham.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Court of Requests.</i></p>

<p>In the year 1808, the commissioners of this court, who are seventy-two
in number, were empowered by act of parliament to decide any pecuniary
differences between parties, not exceeding the sum of five pounds. The
commissioners, three of whom are a quorum, meet every Friday morning, at
the office, in a court, about the centre of High-street, and nearly
opposite to New-street. Two clerks are constituted by the act to attend
the court, who being always of the law, give their judicial assistance;
they are chosen alternately by the lord of the manor and the
commissioners, being continued for life. At the expiration of two years,
ten of the commissioners are balloted out, and ten other of the
inhabitants are made choice of, as their successors. From the decision
of this court there is no appeal, and there are frequently two hundred
causes decided in one day; there are two sets of commissioners sitting
at the same time, for the dispatch of business, who in general give so
much satisfaction to both parties, that it is very unusual to hear any
remarks made upon their decision.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Humane Society.</i></p>

<p>In the year 1790, a society was formed, under the above title, to assist
in the recovery of persons apparently drowned, which is now transferred
to the hospital.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Society for the Protection of Trade against fraudulent Bankrupts,
Swindlers, etc.</i></p>

<p>This society was formed in the year 1804, to prevent any flagrant
attempts to impose on the honest and unwary, by fraudulent bankrupts and
swindlers, and to detect cheats of every description; also to prevent
the friends and suspected accomplices of such persons from being
appointed assignees or trustees, to the detriment of the creditors at
large.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Chamber of Commerce.</i></p>

<p>In July, 1813, a public meeting was convened, for the purpose of
establishing a bond of union among the mercantile interests in this
town, under the above title; but at present it does not appear to have
made much progress.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Assay Office</i></p>

<p>Is situated in Little Cannon-street, where all plate manufactured in
this town and its vicinity must be sent, for the purpose of ascertaining
the quality of the silver and being stamped with the proper marks,
denoting that it is standard, and has paid the proper duties.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Gold and Silver.</i>  The quantity of these precious metals consumed in
this town and neighbourhood every week is incalculable, and if it could
be ascertained would appear incredible; there being in wrought plate
about two thousand ounces; but the quantity of silver used in plating of
different articles, it is not possible to discover, nor can the quantity
of gold used in different manufactories be made known, but it is
computed by those who have the best means of obtaining information on
the subject, that there are more than one hundred ounces of gold
purchased by the gilders every week, which is spread over the articles
in such a superficial manner, that not a single ounce of it ever returns
to the crucible again. From the same source of information, it is
computed that there are more than one thousand ounces of silver used
every week, which never reverts back again in its pristine state as
silver.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Copper.</i></p>

<p>There being a great consumption of this article in the different
manufactories, a society was formed in the year 1790, under the title of
<i>The Birmingham Mining and Copper Company.</i></p>

<p>Who, having established connexions at Redruth, in Cornwall, and Swansea,
in Wales, the copper is brought to this town, and disposed of among the
manufacturers, to the mutual advantage of both parties.</p>

<p>In the year 1793, there being a great demand for this article,
on account of a national copper coinage, an association
was entered into, who stiled themselves
<i>The Rose Copper Company,</i></p>

<p>Who established smelting works at Swansea, in Wales,
and principally vend the article in this town.</p>

<p>Trade continuing to increase, a third establishment
took place, in 1803, under the name of
<i>The Crown Copper Company,</i></p>

<p>Who erected smelting houses, and render the article
in a proper state for sale, at Neath, in Wales.</p>

<p>Envious of other people's prosperity, a fourth company obtruded itself
upon the public, called the Union, who having overstocked the market,
disposed of their concern to the other companies, and dissolved itself.</p>

<p>Under this head, the editor considers it no more than an act of justice,
to observe, that the manufacture of copper bolts, for fastening the
timbers of ships together, was invented by Mr. John Westwood, an
inhabitant of this town.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Brass.</i></p>

<p>This article, so necessary to the manufacturers in this town, was for a
great length of time procured from the wealthy people of Bristol, which
caused a manufactory, of brass to be established here, about the year
1740, but that being upon a small scale, the principal supply came from
the place before-mentioned, until the year 1781, when a number of
manufacturers associated together, and established a manufactory of
brass, upon an extensive scale, in this town, under the denomination of
<i>The Birmingham Metal Company.</i></p>

<p>For the purpose of supplying themselves and their neighbours with that
article, at a regular rate; the Bristol people being accustomed to raise
or fall the price at discretion. This gave rise to another company, who
erected extensive works, and established a manufactory of brass, at
Smethwick.</p>

<p>Trade increasing, a third company was formed, who erected works, and
commenced manufacturing of brass, at Spon-lane, West-bromwich; so that
the town is now amply supplied with that article; for the companies at a
distance have their agents, who dispose of large quantities.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Steel House.</i></p>

<p>In the beginning of the last century, a furnace was erected on the
outside of the town, for the conversion of iron into steel, and houses
being erected in its vicinity, they were denominated Steelhouse-lane.
That the woollen manufactory is of great importance to this kingdom must
be admitted, but if the demand for fine steel goods should ever revive
again, and be equally brisk as it was thirty years back, there is not in
my mind a doubt, but the iron and steel trade would produce more profit
to the nation than that of woollen, if it does not at the present time.
Wool is produced from the surface of the earth, and iron is by dint of
labour collected from its bowels; consider the numerous hands employed
in the mines and the furnaces to bring it into a rough state, either for
casting or the forge, and when it is in a proper state for either, the
endless variety of articles it is manufactured into; the whole export of
which, being all produced by labour, is every shilling of it profit to
the nation. Gold can only be wrought in any quantities to a certain
determinate value, but who can fix the price at which articles made of
steel may be sold. Should it please the Almighty to continue the
blessings of a general peace, the people on the continent will soon
recover themselves, and whenever that is the case, and money circulates
freely among them, they will then turn their thoughts to superfluities,
and as no other article will bear so high a polish and appear so
brilliant as those which are manufactured of steel, there is the
greatest probability of that trade being revived.&mdash;An attempt to
enumerate the different articles now made in iron and steel, would be in
vain; yet none of the more valuable are at this time in request.</p>

<p>Previous to the year 1760, there were very few travellers, (if any,)
went from Birmingham with intent to sell the manufactures; the custom at
that time, and for many years afterwards, was, for the ironmongers in
different parts of the kingdom to bring their money and orders with
them, and to wait until the goods were brought in, and see them packed
before they left the town. The ironmongers in large towns then supplied
their neighbours in smaller places with the different articles, and
numbers of people used to attend different markets, where they kept a
stock of goods.</p>

<p>This mode of conducting business being both troublesome and expensive,
the ironmongers, instead of coming twice a year as some of them did,
deputed some person to receive goods on their account, allowing a
commission for so doing. This opened the eyes of those who received the
goods, and induced them to collect patterns and travel on their own
account; which being found advantageous, it has been practised ever
since.</p>

<p>Twenty years back the trades carried on in this town were, with few
exceptions, light articles, that depended upon fancy, but since that
time, there have been numerous works established for manufacturing
useful and substantial articles, both for the foreign market and home
consumption; and the orders are so extensive that several people keep
carts, for the purpose of delivering their own manufacture to the
merchant.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Principal Manufactories.</i></p>

<p>Within this town are manufactured every metallic article, both for use
and ornament, that can be necessary in a house; the variety of japan
goods, both useful and ornamental, is prodigious; the brass founders
produce an infinite variety of articles; and the platers also; the
manufacturers of buttons, guns, swords, locks of every kind, jewellery
and toys, employ the greatest part of the population. To these may be
added a great variety of articles, exclusively for the foreign trade.
Lately a manufactory of watches has been established, upon a very
extensive scale, in gold, silver, metal, and covered cases.</p>

<br>

<p><i>Birmingham Canals.</i></p>

<p>In the year 1767 an act of parliament was obtained to cut a canal from
this town to the collieries, which was completed in 1769, at the expence
of &pound;70000, being 500 shares at &pound;140. each, which in 1782 was sold for
&pound;370. in 1792, &pound;1170 was the price of them, and when the first meeting
was held respecting the grand junction canal, in the church, at Stony
Stratford, one was there sold for &pound;1375. Since that time, the
proprietors have been authorised by parliament to divide each share into
two parts, which is in fact doubling the number of shares, in order that
they may be rendered more saleable, and for one of these divided shares,
&pound;900 was offered and refused in the summer of 1818. There is now a
regular communication by water between this town, London, Liverpool,
Manchester, and Bristol; to the three former places, goods are delivered
on the fourth day, upon a certainty; there being relays of horses
stationed every fifteen miles.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Worcester Canal</i></p>

<p>Was opened for the passage of boats, by forming a junction with the
Birmingham canal, on the 21st of July, 1815, by means of which goods may
be conveyed from the upper part of this town, to London, one whole day
sooner than they can by steering immediately into the Warwick canal. At
King's-Norton, this canal is conveyed under ground, by means of a
tunnel, two miles in length, which is in width 16 feet and in height 18
feet, yet it is so admirably constructed, that any person by looking in
at one end, may perceive day-light at the other extremity. The pound of
water extends on a level for the space of fourteen miles, when it
descends into the river Severn by means of fifty-eight locks.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Warwick Canal</i></p>

<p>Was opened for the passage of boats, by forming a junction with the
Birmingham canal, in the year 1800.</p>

<p>A communication being opened between the Birmingham and Worcester
canals, in the year 1815, there are now two different routes by which
goods may be conveyed from this town to London, by water; one of them
is, by an immediate junction of the Birmingham canal with the Warwick,
which is accomplished by means of nineteen locks; the other is, by
passing into the Worcester canal, on the same level; from thence into
the Stratford canal, which is also on the same level, and from thence
into the Warwick canal.</p>

<p>Boats from the wharfs within the town; Bird's, White-house's,
Robinson's, and Crowley's, are capable of delivering goods in London one
whole day sooner by the latter route than they can do by the other, and
the merchants and ironmongers in the metropolis are hereby informed of
that circumstance. The boat-owners by proceeding on this route, are
necessitated to advance a small sum of immediate money, for tonnage,
more than they do on the other route; to counterbalance that, the boats
are exempt from the wear and tear of passing through twelve locks, and
an extra day's expense; therefore, when both circumstances are taken
into consideration, the expenses cannot vary much either way, and to the
London merchant one day is, at times, of the utmost importance.&mdash;On that
account, there is no doubt that those who are apprised of this
circumstance, will order their goods to be conveyed by way of the
Stratford canal.</p>

<p>The trade of this town has within the last fifteen years increased in an
astonishing manner; for in the year 1803, six weekly boats were
sufficient to convey all the merchandize to and from this town to
Manchester and Liverpool, but at the present time, there are at least
twenty boats weekly employed in that trade.</p>

<p>At the same period, the competition was so great between the carriers to
London, that they procured a number of boats, but it was with difficulty
they could find lading for five or six in a week; whereas, at the
present time, there are at least eighteen boats per week, constantly
employed at the different wharfs in that traffic.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Theatre.</i></p>

<p>This superb pile of building was erected in 1774, and an additional
portico in 1780, the whole together forming one of the most elegant
theatres in Europe. There are in the front of it, over the attic
windows, two busts, in bas relief, of exquisite workmanship; one
representing Shakespear, and the other Garrick.</p>

<p>In the month of August, 1792, the interior of this building was in a
malicious manner set on fire, which consumed all the scenery, dresses,
etc. and although liberal rewards were offered for the discovery of the
incendiaries, no proof could be established, though suspicions were very
strong. Thus circumstanced, the proprietors purchased several adjoining
houses, and in the space of four years re-erected the theatre, upon an
enlarged scale, so that it will contain more than 2000 people. In the
centre building, towards the front, is an elegant assembly room, which
is fitted up in a sumptuous style, and the two wings are occupied as a
tavern, which, from the great author of the drama, is called the
Shakespear.  In the year 1807, it was made a royal theatre, and on that
account the proprietors are entitled to let it for such performances as
other royal theatres are, without being under controul of the
magistrates.</p>

<p>As a theatre, it opens in June and closes in September.</p>

<p>This substantial and well-constructed pile of building, being on a line
with the street, it cannot be seen to any advantage, except you ascend
the roof of St. Philip's church. This theatre is now lighted by means of
gas, in a most brilliant manner.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Musical Festival.</i></p>

<p>Once in three years, during the month of October, the vocal and
instrumental performers of the first class are assembled here in greater
numbers than any other part of the kingdom can boast. They are collected
together at a prodigious expense, for the purpose of performing
oratorios, three successive mornings, in the church of St. Philip. In
the evening of each day, select concerts are performed in the theatre;
and when those performances are closed, the company who are assembled,
whilst they are under the same roof, are ushered into an elegant and
well-furnished ball room, where they amuse themselves for the remainder
of the evening; refreshments being provided upon the spot. These
performances are conducted in such a superior style, that great numbers
of the nobility and gentry who reside at a considerable distance, are
induced to attend.  The profits arising from these musical
entertainments being appropriated to the benefit of the General
Hospital, many of them contribute in a very liberal manner by donations
to that institution. The last performances took place in October, 1817,
when the committee of managers, after they had defrayed all incidental
expences, paid to the treasurers of the general hospital the sum of
&pound;4296. 10s. 10d. the total receipts being &pound;8476. 6s. 9d.</p>

<p>The next festival is intended to be celebrated in October, 1820.</p>

<p>There being two rooms of large dimensions, that are each of them fitted
up in a style of elegance, as ball rooms, one at the hotel in
Temple-row, and the other adjoining the theatre in New-street, there are
during winter, subscription concerts and assemblies held at each of
them.</p>

<p>Independant of these, private concerts are occasionally held at each of
them; those at the hotel being of some years' establishment, the room,
although eighty feet in length and thirty-three in breadth, is so
completely occupied, that any person who is desirous of becoming a
member must probably wait two or three years before they can obtain
admission.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Panorama.</i></p>

<p>A pile of building was erected in New-street, for the purpose of
exhibiting paintings of this description, which has lately been
converted into an auction room.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Deritend House.</i></p>

<p>This stone-fronted mansion was erected in 1786, as a tavern, under the
name of the Apollo, and in consequence of its bowling green, was for
several years much frequented. It was afterwards divided into two
private houses; but in 1816 being purchased by Wm. Hamper, Esq. that
gentleman greatly improved the premises and again converted it into one
dwelling, which he makes his residence, and which, from its extensive
gardens and pleasant situation, is much admired.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Duddeston or Vauxhall,</i></p>

<p>So called after that place of fashionable resort near London, is little
more than a mile from the centre of the town.</p>

<p>This was the ancient residence of the Holt family, and within memory
contained some good paintings, as the gardens did a number of lead
statues, large as life, and some smaller ones; but depredations being
committed by stealing some of them, the others were removed.</p>

<p>These delightful gardens, which contain a very spacious bowling green,
an orchestra, a great number of commodious gravel walks, on the borders
of which are numerous lofty trees, of various kinds, together with
parterres, where flowers of different sorts were accustomed to be seen,
were, till of late years, resorted to by none but the genteeler sort of
people, and from their retired situation, are every way capable of being
made one of the most rural retreats for public amusement of any in the
kingdom.  Times are now completely changed, it being turned into an
alehouse, where persons of all descriptions may be accommodated with
that or any other liquor, on which account the upper classes of the
inhabitants have entirely absented themselves.</p>

<p>By adopting this method, the editor is of opinion, that the present
occupier is accumulating more money than any of his predecessors.&mdash;There
are, during summer, fire works occasionally exhibited, and sometimes
concerts of vocal and instrumental music.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Crescent.</i></p>

<p>Several years have now elapsed since a plot of ground, 1182 feet in
length, forming a terrace seventeen feet above the wharfs, was laid out
for the purpose of erecting some superior buildings in that form, and
the wings were soon after constructed according to the plan; but as yet
very little progress has been made in the central buildings.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Barracks.</i></p>

<p>In the year 1793, government took a lease of five acres of land, near
Ashsted chapel, at the rate of one penny per square yard, whereon they
expended the sum of thirteen thousand pounds, in the erection of
barracks to accommodate one hundred and sixty-two men, with their

<p><i>Birmingham Fire Office.</i></p>

<p>In the month of March, 1805, the monied interest in this town opened an
institution under the above title; there being three hundred
subscribers, at &pound;1000. each. Their office is in Union-street, which for
chasteness of design is equal to any other building in the town.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Inland Commercial Society.</i></p>

<p>The merchants, and others, who were accustomed to send goods to, or
receive them from Liverpool, having experienced, not only great delays,
but the packages being pilfered, to their great prejudice, established
this concern, in order to counteract such proceedings in future.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Theological Library.</i></p>

<p>The first rector of St. Philip's church, the Rev. Wm. Higgs, having
bequeathed this library for the use of the clergy in Birmingham, and its
vicinity, and the sum of two hundred pounds to make further purchases, a
handsome library was erected by the Rev. Spencer Madan, in the year 1792
for its reception, adjoining to the parsonage house, he being at that
time rector.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Public Library.</i></p>

<p>An institution under this title was established in the year 1779, and is
now held in an elegant pile of building, erected on the tontine
principle, by the subscribers, situated in Union-street. In front of the
building is the following inscription:</p>

AD MERCATURAM BONARUM ARTIUM PROFECTUS, ET TIBI ET<br>
OMNIBUS DITESCES.<br>

<p>Which is thus englished,&mdash;</p>

RESORTING TO THE MART THE SCIENCES, YOU WILL GROW RICH,<br>
BOTH FOR YOURSELF AND OTHERS.<br>

<p>This library contains about sixteen thousand volumes, and there are
about five hundred and sixty subscribers.</p>
<br>

<p><i>New Library.</i></p>

<p>Some disagreement arising among the subscribers to the public library,
gave rise to this institution, which was established in the year 1796,
in a commodious room for the purpose, situated at the lower part of
Cannon-street, where there are about three thousand volumes.&mdash;From the
committee of this library I have received every assistance, and from the
librarian every information it was in his power to give.</p>
<br>

<p><i>General Provident Society.</i></p>

<p>This society originated in the year 1800, for the benefit of the working
class; it consists of upwards of four hundred members, who are aided by
about fifty-five honorary members, who contribute annually to the fund,
which consists of three thousand four hundred pounds, funded property. A
member when sick receives eight shillings per week, and when past the
age of sixty-five, he receives four shillings per week during his life.
The dependant subscribers contribute no more than four-pence per week,
although, in addition to the foregoing, they receive medical assistance
gratia.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Clubs.</i></p>

<p>Under this denomination, the workmen assemble at the public-houses they
usually resort to, and by contributing a small sum weekly, they raise a
fund, from whence, if any member is afflicted with illness, he receives
a certain sum for his support, according to the rules of the society to
which he belongs; every separate club having rules and orders peculiar
to themselves.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Piddock's Trust.</i></p>

<p>In the year 1728, William Piddock devised his farm, containing about
nine acres of land, at Winson Green, in trust, for the purpose of
educating and putting out apprentice, poor boys belonging to the parish
of Birmingham, or other discretional charities. It is vested in the
constables, church-wardens, and overseers for the time being. This
estate now produces about I cannot learn what.</p>
<br>

<p>The baneful effects produced by spirituous liquors, which has made such
dreadful havoc among the populace in many other manufacturing towns, is,
to the credit of the working people, very little encouraged.</p>

<p>To the credit of the inhabitants, the spirit of gambling is almost
unknown here; there being more of it practised in many small towns than
there is in this extensive one. The magistrates invariably suppress
those public houses where it is encouraged.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Wilday's Royal Hotel, Temple-row.</i></p>

<p>As a proof how salubrious the air is in this neighbourhood, this
capacious and substantial pile of building was erected in the year
1772, upon the tontine principle; divided into fifty shares, at &pound;100 per
share, and there are at this time, October, 1818, forty-five of the
parties, whose lives were nominated, now alive.</p>

<p>It has an elegant entrance through a capacious saloon, at the extremity
of which there is a noble flight of stairs, leading to an elegant and
spacious assembly room, in length, including the orchestra, wherein
there is a handsome and fine-toned organ, eighty feet, and in breadth
thirty-three feet. It is fitted up in a tasteful and decorative manner,
with three rich cut-glass chandeliers, five lustres, and six large
mirrors.</p>

<p>This hotel is considered one of the first in point of comfort and
accommodation, and not being subject to the annoyance of stage coaches,
makes it a very desirable residence for families who think proper to
reside any time in the town, to inspect the different manufactories and
show rooms.</p>

<p>This hotel has been honoured with the presence of Prince William of
Gloucester, Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, the Grand Duchess of
Oldenburgh (now Queen of Wirtemberg, and sister of Alexander, Emperor of
Russia), the King of France, the Grand Dukes Nicholas and Michael, etc.
etc. This house is also considered one of the first in the kingdom for
the accommodation of posting, where an extensive supply of horses and
carriages are always in readiness.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Statue to the Memory of Lord Nelson.</i></p>

<p>Nearly at the top of the market-place, and fronting St. Martin's church,
a statue of this never-to-be-forgotten hero was exposed to public view,
on the 25th of October, 1809; the day on which was celebrated the
jubilee of our august sovereign George 3d. It was executed in bronze, by
Westmacott, a statuary of the first eminence, at the expense of &pound;2500,
which was raised by voluntary subscription, to immortalize the memory of
that much-lamented admiral. The attitude of the figure is expressive of
that dignity and serenity with which the original was characterised, and
the resemblance is upon the whole admitted to be more than usually
correct. The circular pedestal whereon it is erected, is ornamented with
figures in alto relievo, in a bold and masterly style, the limbs being
so disposed, that except real violence is used, they are not liable to
be injured. The relative proportion of the whole is admirable, and the
general effect it produces gives the utmost satisfaction. As an artist,
every praise is due to Mr. Westmacott, for the admirable skill he has
displayed, and also for his unassuming conduct in presence of the
committee, who had been appointed to superintend its execution.</p>

<p>On the scaffolding being removed, and the statue exhibited to public
inspection, the following illustration of it was distributed by Mr.
Westmacott:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;In this work, intended to perpetuate the greatest example of naval
genius, simplicity has been the chief object in the arrangement. The
hero is represented in a reposed and dignified attitude, his left arm
reclining upon an anchor: he appears in the costume of his native
country, invested with the insignia of those honours by which his
sovereign and distant princes distinguished him. To the right of the
statue, the grand symbol of the naval profession is introduced. Victory,
the constant attendant upon her favourite hero, embellishes the prow. To
the left is disposed a sail, which being placed behind the statue,
gives breadth to that view of the composition. Above the ship is a
facsimile of the Flag Staff Truck of l'Orient, which was fished up by
Sir Samuel Hood, the day following the battle of the Nile, and presented
by him to Lord Nelson; the same being deposited at Mitford, as a trophy
of that ever-memorable action. This group is surmounted upon a pedestal
of statuary marble; a circular form having been selected, as best
adapted to the situation. To personify that affectionate regard which
caused the present patriotic tribute to be raised, the town of
Birmingham is represented in a dejected attitude, murally crowned,
mourning her loss; she being accompanied by groups of genii, or
children, in allusion to the rising generation, who offer consolation to
her, by producing the trident and the rudder.&quot;</p>

<p>In front of the pedestal is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

THIS STATUE<br>
IN HONOUR OF<br>
ADMIRAL<br>
LORD NELSON,<br>
WAS ERECTED<br>
BY THE<br>
INHABITANTS OF BIRMINGHAM<br>
A. D. MDCCCIX.<br>

<p>The whole is inclosed by iron palisadoes, in the form of boarding pikes,
connected by a twisted cable. At each of the four corners is fixed a
cannon, erect, from which issues a lamp post, representing a cluster of
pikes, supporting a ship lantern.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Joseph Farror, of this town, at his decease, bequeathed
six-pence per week, to be paid for ever, out of rents arising from a
house in Bradford-street, for keeping the basement and statue of Lord
Nelson clean and free from dirt, which is received by the wardens of St.
Martin's church.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Proof House.</i></p>

<p>Although government have at all times a large store of fire arms in the
tower of London, yet, after the revolution had taken place in France,
and England was threatened with an invasion, the numerous volunteers who
offered their services at that time, to repel the enemy, required such a
profusion to be distributed among them, that it became necessary to
purchase large quantities from any part of the continent where they
could be procured; and the volunteers of this town were supplied with
muskets from Prussia. The words 'liberty' and 'equality', used by the
French military, produced such an effect on the continent, that England
was necessitated to manufacture arms for its own defence. Thus situated,
application was made to the gun-makers in this town, but the number of
hands at that time employed in the trade was so limited, that they could
only supply small quantities; but when war was renewed, after the peace
of Amiens, great encouragement being given by government, the
manufacturers of arms in this town were, in the year 1804, enabled to
supply five thousand stand of arms monthly.</p>

<p>At that time, so many workmen had obtained a knowledge of the trade,
that in the year 1809 the government were supplied with twenty thousand
stand of arms monthly, and in 1810, the number was increased from
twenty-eight to thirty thousand monthly; and that number was regularly
supplied until the peace of Paris.</p>

<p>In order to expedite the business, a proof house was established by
government, in Lancaster-street, under an inspector from the board of
ordnance.</p>

<p>An act of parliament was obtained in the year 1813, for the erection of
a proof house in this town, where all barrels of guns, pistols,
blunderbusses, etc. must be proved and marked, under a severe penalty;
and since that time, the manufacturing of fowling pieces has increased
to a considerable degree.</p>

<p>It is situated on the banks of the canal, in Banbury-street, and is
conducted under the direction of three wardens, who are annually made
choice of from the body of guardians and trustees, they being nominated
in the act of parliament.<a name="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> In addition to them, the Lords Lieutenants
for the counties of Warwick, Worcester, and Stafford, the members
serving in parliament for the said counties, for the time being,
respectively, and the magistrates acting within seven miles of the town
of Birmingham, are appointed as guardians.</p>

<p>The corn mill at the bottom of Snowhill was erected about the year 1781:
the brick work of this extensive building, which is excellent in its
kind, was executed by Mr. Edward Jones, according to contract; which
was, for bricks, mortar, and labour, one guinea per thousand. This mill,
and also that adjoining, were erected by the late Mr. James Pickard, and
were the first steam engines that worked by a rotatory motion, he being
the person who first applied the crank to those machines, and for which
invention he obtained a patent, but I do not know that he ever erected
any others; for Messrs. Boulton and Watt, in order to evade the patent,
substituted the sun and planet wheels, which they continued to use until
the patent expired.</p>

<p>At the latter mill, where metal was rolled and other business carried
on, a pump was fixed, and a boy employed to work it, for the purpose of
keeping the machinery cool; but after some time, the youth being
inclined to play, fixed a pole from the engine to the lever of the pump,
which gave rise to the practise that was afterwards followed, of making
the engine supply itself with water for that purpose. The boy for his
ingenuity was afterwards employed withinside the mill.</p>

<p><i>Union Mill.</i></p>

<p>There being a great scarcity of corn in the year 1795, the wealthy
inhabitants raised a subscription, and having purchased a large quantity
of foreign corn, at Liverpool, it was soon conveyed here, but it very
unfortunately happened that at the time, neither wind nor water mills
could be worked, to grind it. From this circumstance, Mr. William Bell,
a man who possessed a fertile genius, suggested the idea of erecting a
steam mill, and set on foot a subscription for that purpose, there being
about seven thousand subscribers, at one pound each. It was for several
years very doubtful whether this mill could be supported or not; but
having surmounted those difficulties, it has for several years been a
very profitable concern; shares being at the present time eagerly sought
after, at three pounds ten shillings per share.</p>

<p>This mill turning out so beneficial, and the boundaries of the town
being extended to a considerable degree, the same Mr. Bell projected
another, which he called
<i>The New Union Mill.</i></p>

<p>Upon a more extensive scale than the former, which was in time carried
into effect; but like other things in an infant state, it has
difficulties to encounter. The committee having expended as much money
in superfluous buildings, as would have supported the mill in credit.</p>

<p>Steam engines are erected in every direction round the town, they being
found to accelerate business, and abridge manual labour.</p>

<p><i>Public Breweries.</i></p>

<p>Of these there are three; one of them situated in Warstone-lane,
belongs to Forrest and Sons; another in Deritend, is the property of
Richards and Goddington; and the third is near Broad-street, conducted
by a public company.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Glass Houses.</i></p>

<p>The manufacture of flint glass, and the various methods of ornamenting
it, gives employment to a great number of people in this town; it having
within the last twenty years increased to a very considerable degree;
there being at this time, in the town and its immediate vicinity, six
glass houses in full work.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Beardsworth's Repository for Horses and Carriages,</i></p>

<p>Is upon an extensive scale, about sixty yards from the S.W. corner of
Smithfield, where there are always a variety of both on sale, and a
public auction takes place every Thursday in the forenoon.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Smithfield</i></p>

<p>Is situated about sixty yards to the S. of St. Martin's church. Neat
cattle, sheep, and pigs being exposed to sale, upon the identical spot
where the ancient barons of Birmingham were accustomed to hold their
midnight revels, and to feast their dependants. The hospitable mansion
having been demolished long since, the moat was filled up, and the
ground prepared in a very commodious manner for the intended purpose,
against Michaelmas Day, 1817, at which time the fair was proclaimed, and
it has since been used as a market.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Inspection of Raw Hides.</i></p>

<p>Parliament having passed an act to prevent frauds from being practised
in raw hides, a very convenient situation was fixed upon for their
examination, in Park-street, where two persons are annually appointed to
inspect them.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Public Scales.</i></p>

<p>A short distance from the statue of Lord Nelson, one of the beadles is
stationed every market day, with the public scales and weights, where
any person may weigh whatever articles of provision they have purchased,
free of expense, which is a very laudable institution, and has proved of
the greatest utility.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Improvements.</i></p>

<p>Within the last twenty years, the interior of the town has experienced
very considerable improvements; numerous houses adjacent to the church
yard of St. Martin have been entirely removed, and the space they
occupied is thrown open to enlarge the market place.</p>

<p>The entrance into several streets have been made considerably wider, and
by that means rendered more commodious; some of the streets have been
re-paved, and the water conveyed by culverts, instead of annoying the
pedestrian as it used to do. Some parts of the town are already lighted
by gas, and preparations are making for the general use of it; but in
those streets where it has been introduced, a great part of the
brilliant light it produces is obscured for want of clean lamps. Those
who have the care of them, either do not know how, or will not be at the
trouble of making a strong lie of ash balls and hot water, which with a
little labour and attention will remove the greasy particles that adhere
to them.&mdash;It having been customary to fix the lamps adjacent to the
houses, the same method is still pursued; but if light cylindrical lamp
posts of cast iron were fixed between the curb stone and the water
course, every part of the street would be benefited by the alteration.
The lamps should be made with a hole in the bottom, similar to those
used in halls, and fit into a socket at the top of the lamp post.</p>

<p>This fashionable mode of producing artificial light, gives employment to
great numbers of people in this town, not only for the use of public
streets, but also elegant branches for the interior of houses.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Newspapers.</i></p>

<p>There are four published in this town: Aris's Gazette, by Mr. Thomas
Knott, jun. on Monday morning; Swinney's Birmingham Chronicle, by Mr.
James Ferrall, on Wednesday evening; the Birmingham Commercial Herald,
by Messrs. Richard Jabet and Co. on Saturday evening; also, the Argus,
on the same evening.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Markets.</i></p>

<p>Although there is not any shelter for the country people, yet in the
most stormy weather this town is abundantly supplied with provisions of
all kinds, every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday. This being the grand
mart, the fertile vale of Evesham pours forth its fruit and vegetables
in great profusion; and as auxiliaries, the vicinity of Tamworth and
also of Lichfield send hither great quantities; in short, whatever
provisions of a good quality are brought here, the market is never
overstocked.</p>

<p>The butchers in this town are dispersed over every part of it, where
they live and enjoy those comforts with their families that it is not
possible to do when they are congregated together in shambles; and in
this extensive town, no person is necessitated to lose much time, or
walk far from home, to provide for his family.</p>

<p>Considering the distance from hence to the sea coast, the inhabitants
are well supplied with fish of various kinds, and at a moderate price.</p>

<p>Opposite the quaker's meeting in Bull-street, there is, in front of the
house occupied by Mr. Standley, a most admirable piece of brick-work,
(the lock-maker's arms, under a most beautiful arch), such as is very
seldom seen, and does infinite credit to whoever executed it; but some
simpleton has defaced the arms to a considerable degree, by colouring
them to represent stone. This was about as necessary as paint is for the
faces of women:&mdash;to make them look worse afterwards. This exquisite
performance appears to have been done about one hundred and fifty years;
the house having been invariably in the possession of a person eminent
as a lock-maker during the above period.</p>

<p>In Moor-street, there is another specimen of the same kind, about one
hundred yards above the public office, which was executed in the year
1671, being arms, a chevron between three goats' heads, and a goat's
head for a crest. Such specimens of brick work as these are very seldom
seen.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Square</i>.</p>

<p>There is near the centre of the town, what is called the Square; the
buildings which surround it were uniform; but one eighth part was some
years back fronted with stone, and converted into a tavern, which is
denominated the Stork. This house of entertainment, from its private
situation and being near the centre of the town, is much resorted to by
travellers; there being capacious stabling behind, and in front there
are some shrubs, inclosed by iron pallisadoes. For those who are at
leisure, there is an excellent billiard table.</p>
<br>

<p><i>John-a-Dean's Hole.</i></p>

<p>At the bottom of Digbeth, about forty yards from Deritend Bridge, there
is on the left a water course that receives a small drain from Digbeth,
and also from the adjacent lands; which stream separates the parishes of
Aston and Birmingham, and is known by the name of John-a-Dean's hole,
from a person of that name who is said to have lost his life there.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Baths, near Lady Well,</i></p>

<p>Are always ready for the accommodation of hot or cold bathing, and also
for immersion or amusement, together with sudorific apartments. The
swimming bath is in length thirty-six yards, and in breadth eighteen
yards, containing more than 2000 hogsheads of spring water, and
gradually slopes from the depth of one to five feet; being situated in
the centre of a garden, wherein are twenty-four apartments to undress
and dress in; the whole being surrounded by a wall, ten feet high, and
fine lofty trees. There are also very decent baths in Newtown-row, near
Lancaster-street.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Houses</i>.</p>

<p>By an accurate survey, taken in the year 1810, it appears that there
were then 9196 front houses, and 8214 back houses, within the connected
streets of Birmingham, which, reckoning five and a half to a house,
makes the population 97,405. There appears to be about 400 houses
erected annually, which will make the number at the present time 18510,
and the population 101,805.</p>

<p>The old Roman road, denominated  Ikenield-street, that extends from
Southampton to Tyremouth, enters this parish near the observatory in
Ladywood-lane, crosses the road to Dudley at the Sand Pits, and
proceeding along Warstone-lane, leaves the parish in Hockley-brook; but
is distinctly to be seen at the distance of five miles, both in Sutton
park and on the Coldfield, in perfect repair, as when the Romans left
it.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Parsonage House</i></p>

<p>Of St. Martin, situated near Smallbrook-street, is in all probability
one of the most ancient entire buildings in this part of the country; it
being a low, half-timbered erection, surrounded by a moat; in front of
which is, what was the tythe barn, being near sixty yards in length,
now made use of as warehouses.</p>

<p>By late regulations in the post office, an innovation has crept in that
is highly reprehensible, and ought not to be continued. Before mail
coaches were established, Coleshill was a place of considerably more
note then, as a post town, than Birmingham, it being very common for
people in the north to direct their letters for Birmingham, to turn at
Coleshill. This being the case, if the directors of the post office
think proper to change the route for their own convenience, that is no
reason why the public should be charged with the expense. Dudley and
Coleshill being both of them the same distance from Birmingham, what
reason can be assigned why a letter to Dudley should be four-pence and
to Coleshill six-pence?</p>

<p>The country for a few miles round the town is in every direction studded
with houses, belonging to the opulent inhabitants of Birmingham, or of
those who have retired from the busy scenes of life.</p>

<p>Whoever walks much about this town, will perceive one very remarkable
circumstance: at the top of a street you ascend into the houses by a
flight of steps, and in the lower part of the same street, you descend
into some of the houses; this is exemplified in Edmund-street, and
particularly in Newhall-street and Lionel-street.</p>

<p>There are two fairs in the year, one of them is held on Thursday in the
Whitsun week, and the other on the last Thursday in September: the
horses being exposed for sale in Bristol-street; the neat cattle, sheep,
and pigs in Smithfield.</p>

<p>The established market is on Thursday, but the town being so populous,
there is a very good market both on Monday and Saturday. Hay and straw
are exposed for sale every Tuesday, in Smithfield.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Jackson's Trust.</i></p>

<p>George Jackson, of Birmingham, mercer, gave certain premises, in
Deritend, for placing out two apprentices, annually; present rent, six
pounds per annum.</p>

<p>Some years back, the church of St. Martin being under repair, the
workmen discovered that the four pinnacles, (one at each corner of the
tower), were very much decayed, upon which, the powers at that time in
authority concluded, that they should be re-constructed, and to make a
finish, fixed a vane upon each of them, without considering, that, the
steeple being in the centre, it was not possible for the wind invariably
to act upon all alike; consequently, any other termination would have
been more appropriate.</p>

<p>In the jurisprudence of this town, there is one remarkable circumstance;
the chief constable of Hemlingford hundred, wherein Birmingham is
situated, is of course superior to the two constables of this town; yet
they, by virtue of their office, preside over the common prison, and of
course the appointment of prison-keeper is vested in them; but, strange
to relate, the chief constable of the hundred is keeper of the prison,
in Birmingham: consequently, although he is their superior, he is at
the same time subservient to them.</p>

<p><i>Private Carriages</i>.</p>

<p>Within this town and its immediate vicinity there are more than fifty
carriages, of different descriptions, on four wheels, and upwards of
three hundred on two wheels, that pay the duty.</p>

<p>The number of hackney coaches that ply in the streets is twelve, under
the following regulated fares.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;"><i>Hackney Coach Fares.</i></span><br>

<p>For every forty minutes, one shilling, and for every twenty minutes
afterwards, six-pence in addition. If employed, or kept in waiting,
betwixt the hours of twelve o'clock at night and five o'clock in the
morning, double the above fares are allowed.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Baskerville, whose printed works are in such high
estimation, both for paper and print, resided at a place called Easy
Hill, at that time quite distant from the town; the house being
encircled by an extensive paddock. At this place he erected a mill for
the making of paper, in which article he excelled all his
contemporaries, as he also did in the formation of his types, which, to
the disgrace of this country, were permitted to be sold into France.
This once delightful spot is now surrounded with buildings, the house
wherein he resided is converted into a manufactory, and the land into
wharfs.</p>

<p>About twenty yards above the statue in honour of Lord Nelson, there was
within memory the market cross, from whence the roads in every direction
were measured; but from some cause or other, that custom has been
altered, and it is difficult to say from what part of the town some of
the roads are now measured; for example, the road to Walsall. This road
having been considerably shortened and improved, is now considered to be
eight miles distant: (it was some years back, ten miles); but from the
centre of one town to that of the other, will measure nine miles; and
whoever travels that road must very justly pay for that distance.</p>

<p>The road to Stourbridge and Kidderminster is another instance where the
mile stones are not to be depended upon; for the one mile stone on that
road is considerably more than that distance from the centre of the
town.</p>

<p>The horse roads round this town were, within memory, from the rains,
constant wear, and no repair, worn into such hollow ways, that in some
instances, particularly in Bordesley, a waggon, when loaded with hay,
the top of it was not so high as the foot path on the side: it was at
one time fifty-eight feet below the surface. There are still remaining
two specimens of the old roads, but they have been for many years
useless, except in going to the adjacent grounds. One of them is
situated a little beyond the sign of the Bell, on the right hand side
of the Worcester road, and leads towards the Five Ways. The other begins
at Edgbaston church, and continues till you arrive at the toll-gate, on
the Bromsgrove road; but, thanks to the trustees of the turnpikes, the
roads in every direction are now upon a par with others, and in one
respect surpass most of them throughout the kingdom, by having on the
side of every one, a foot path, for the accommodation of pedestrians.</p>

<p>This town, not being restricted by any charter, strangers from whatever
quarter they may come, here find an asylum, and pursue their avocations
with as much freedom, and are no more subject to molestation, than a
native inhabitant. Trade of every kind may be exercised here, and let a
person's religious opinions be whatever they may, he is at liberty to
exercise them; there being in this town eight places of public worship,
according to the establishment, one for the society of friends, two for
protestant dissenters, three for calvinists, two for Roman catholics,
four for methodists, four for baptists, one for Swedenburgians, one for
jews, and one for the followers of Lady Huntingdon.</p>

<p>The buildings in this town extend to the distance of near three miles in
every direction, reckoning from the top of Camphill, and it was some
years back, upon a certainty, the largest town in the kingdom. This was
ascertained by actual measurement; for soon after Mr. Aikin published
his history of Manchester, Mr. John Snape, a very accurate surveyor,
drew a plan of this town, upon the same scale as Mr. Aikin's. Since that
time, I cannot say which of the two towns have encreased the most; but,
if Manchester has extended its buildings with more rapidity than
Birmingham, it is a very extensive place.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the extent of this town, there is very little
distinction between it and a village; all the difference is, its fairs
and market, for the smallest town has a constable to preside over it,
and this, although so extensive and populous, is governed by two
constables.</p>

<p>Although this town is of such considerable magnitude, and one of the
principal thoroughfares between London and Dublin, there are no more
than three places where the superior class of travellers can be
accommodated with horses and carriages; the Royal Hotel, near St.
Philip's church; the Swan Hotel, in High-street, and the Hen and
Chickens Hotel, in New-street.</p>

<p>For the accommodation of the next class, there are the following taverns
and inns: the Stork, in the Square; the Nelson, opposite the statue of
his lordship, in the market-place; the Union, in Union-street; the
Saracen's Head, in Bull-street; the George, and the Castle, in
High-street; the Red Lion, the George, and the White Hart, in Digbeth;
the Rose, in Edgbaston-street; and the, Woolpack, in Moor-street.</p>

<p>From the Nelson, the Swan, the Hen and Chickens, the Saracen's Head, the
George, or the Castle, those who travel by public carriages may be
conveyed to any part of the kingdom.  The principal avenue leading to
and from this town is Great Hampton-street, which, as its name imports,
is on the road to Wolverhampton, but it is also the road to Walsall and
likewise to Dudley. In this capacious road several streets concentrate,
but I would recommend a stranger to proceed down Snowhill.</p>

<p>The next avenue, in point of importance, is Camphill, on the road to
Stratford, where several streets and roads are united.</p>

<p>It is deserving of notice, that however large or small the houses are,
the partition walls are uniformly brick and mortar, and with few
exceptions, the floors of small houses are laid with quarries, which in
a great degree accounts for there being so few fires of any consequence
within this extensive town.</p>

<p>There is not any thing in this town, or its immediate vicinity, that can
attract the attention of an antiquarian: it appears that there once was
a castle, encircled by a moat, situated near the Icknield-street, or
Warstone-lane; the foundation of which is still perceptible, and covered
an area of twenty square perch; but the ground whereon it stood has been
so frequently turned over, that it is only by the difference in the
verdure that it can be discovered.</p>

<p>The present occupier of the land has at different times taken up about
four thousand of the bricks, which were burnt very hard, and resembled
those now in use, but were not so large.</p>

<p>About four miles distant there once stood Weoliegh castle, which was
surrounded by a moat; but the site of the castle is now a garden, and
not a vestige of the building remains, except a small part of the
foundation, which may be discovered at the edge of the moat, that
remaining entire.</p>

<p>Having concluded my observations respecting the public concerns of
Birmingham, I cannot restrain myself from remarking, that there is at
Warwick castle a most magnificent marble bacchanalian vase, of
astonishing dimensions, it being seven feet in diameter and twenty-one
in circumference, which is encircled on the outside with fruit, leaves,
and branches of the vine, the latter being entwined so as to form two
massive handles, with grotesque masks at the end of each; the whole
being in exact proportion to the magnitude of the vase. This unique
specimen of ancient sculpture was discovered in the baths of the Emperor
Adrian, and presented by the Queen of Naples to Sir Wm. Hamilton, the
British ambassador at that court, by whom it was forwarded as a present
to the late Earl of Warwick; who, when it was unpacked, and he had taken
a survey of it, immediately gave orders for the erection of a splendid
green-house, wherein it is now deposited.</p>

<p>Mr. E. Thomason, of this town, who had been a pupil of the late Mr.
Boulton, at Soho, no sooner saw this remarkable production of the fine
arts, than he conceived the idea of forming one of the same magnitude in
metal; and accordingly solicited permission to make models from it,
which his lordship in the most condescending manner permitted him to do.
Mr. Thomason without delay made preparations for the undertaking, and
the metallic vase has been under the hands of different artists above
four years, and is now nearly completed. This unique performance in
metal, is in every respect a perfect resemblance of the original, and
weighs several tons; the ground of it is bronzed, and at the present
time highly relieved in light and shade; but I understand it will, when
complete, be considerably more so, by two novel and distinct processes
of oxydation, that will endure for ages.</p>

<p>This sumptuous metallic vase may be seen at Mr. Thomason's, who
manufactures an endless variety of articles, for several of which he has
obtained letters patent. The royal series of medals, and various others,
are exclusively of his manufacture. Persons of rank who are curious may
there see the art of chasing, or sculpturing in basso and alto relievo,
together with various operations in the art of metallurgy.</p>

<p>OBSERVATIONS</p>

<p>Made during an Excursion</p>
<br>

<p><i>To Wednesbury in Staffordshire, distant eight miles, on the road to
Wolverhampton and Shrewsbury</i>.</p>

<p>You proceed down Snowhill, and having passed the one mile stone, there
are a few trees close to the road side, and opposite to them there is an
extensive view over Barr-beacon, and the adjacent country, including the
lofty trees in Aston park; over whose tops, the elegant spire of that
church is seen. In descending the hill, when you have passed the
buildings, the eye is delighted, on the right hand, with an extensive
view over Hunter's nursery grounds, and on the left is Hockley abbey:
this building was erected upon a piece of waste, boggy land, about the
1779, by Mr. Richard Ford, an ingenious mechanic of Birmingham, who,
among other things, invented a one-wheel carriage, which he constructed
entirely of iron; and for his ingenuity in the formation of that
vehicle, the society of arts presented him with their gold medal. As he
employed a number of hands, several of whom expended nine or ten
shillings each week at the alehouse, it occurred to him, who was not
given to drink, that he would lay aside two shillings every day; and
having done so for a considerable time, as his business required him to
keep a horse and cart; when they were at leisure, he sent them to Aston
furnace,<a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> to bring away large masses of scoriae, usually termed slag
or dross, that lay there in great abundance. Having collected together a
large quantity of it, he began to erect this building, to represent
ruins; and to add to the deception, there is in the front of the house,
in small pebble stones, the date, 1473; and all this was done, as he
informed the writer of this article, without advancing any other money
than the fourteen shillings per week. It is now nearly overgrown with
ivy, and if no account had been given of the materials with which it is
erected, posterity might have been at a loss to know what substance the
walls were built with. Hubert Galton, Esq. now resides there, who pays
rent for the house, and about fifteen acres of land, more than &pound;100. per
annum, exclusive of the enormous parochial taxes of Birmingham, which
for these premises, from Michaelmas, 1816, to Michaelmas, 1817, amounted
to the astonishing sum of sixty-one pounds and ten shillings, viz.
thirty-six levies for the poor, at 30s. each, three highway levies, at
30s. each, and two levies for the church, at 30s. each. In the back
ground, beyond this, is seen a glass-house, belonging to Messrs.
Shakespear and Fletcher.</p>

<a name="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor5">[5]</a><div class=note> A blast furnace, for the making of pig iron, very near at
hand.</div><br>

<p>You now cross the Bourn, a small stream of water, that separates
Warwickshire from the county of Stafford, and passing by Mr. Boulton's
plantations on the left, when you are about half way up the hill, there
is on the right hand, Prospect-house, where the late Mr. Eginton carried
on his manufactory of stained glass.</p>

<p>At the two mile stone, on the left, is the entrance to Soho, where
Matthew Robinson Boulton, Esq. resides, who is proprietor of the
<i>Soho Manufactory</i>.</p>

<p>The road leading to this magnificent pile of building is on the left,
when you have passed through the turnpike. The spot upon which it is
erected, was, in the year 1764, a sterril, barren heath, and so it
continued until 1793, when it was inclosed by act of parliament. The
late Mr. Boulton, in the first instance, expended more than nine
thousand pounds in the erection of buildings, exclusive of machinery. He
soon after removed his manufactory from Birmingham; and then this
enterprising genius established a seminary of artists; men of ingenuity
being sought after, from all parts of Europe, and patronised with the
greatest liberality: thus fostered by his benevolence, they soon
produced an imitation of the <i>or molu</i>.&mdash;These metallic ornaments in
the form of vases, tripods, candelabras, etc. found a ready sale, not
only in this kingdom, but in France, and almost every part of civilized
Europe. This business being established, silver articles were
manufactured in such profusion, that it became necessary to make
application for an assay office to be established in Birmingham; which
was carried into effect in the year 1773.  About this time, a
mechanical process was discovered of copying pictures, in oil colours,
which was brought to such perfection, that the most experienced
connoiseurs were sometimes deceived. The process was chiefly under the
direction of Mr. Francis Eginton, who afterwards commenced the business
of staining glass.</p>

<p>Mr. Watt having obtained a patent for the improvement of steam engines,
came and settled at Soho, in 1769, where he erected an engine, upon his
own principles; which answering the intended purpose, he in 1775,
obtained from parliament a prolongation of his term for twenty-five
years. A partnership being now formed between Mr. Boulton and Mr. Watt,
an extensive manufactory of these engines was established at Soho, and
conveyed from thence to most of the deep mines and extensive works,
where great power was requisite.</p>

<p>In 1788, a mint was erected at Soho, to be worked by the steam engine;
from the rolling of the copper into sheets, afterwards passing it
through steel, polished rollers, and then cutting out the blanks; all
which was performed with the greatest ease and regularity by girls,
instead of employing able men. This was not the whole, for the coining
machines were worked with greater rapidity and exactness, by boys, from
twelve to fourteen years of age, than could be done, by the former
process, by a number of strong men, and their fingers not being in the
least endangered; the machine depositing the blanks upon the dies, and
when struck, it displaced one piece and deposited another.</p>

<p>To facilitate the manufacturing of steam engines, they erected an iron
foundry, at Smethwick, on the banks of the Birmingham canal, where
nearly all the laborious part is consigned to the engine. Engines are
here manufactured from one horse to two hundred horse power, all acting
together. Handsworth common being inclosed, enabled Mr. Boulton to extend
his grounds to a considerable degree, which form an agreeable separation
from his own residence, and forms a much admired scene of picturesque
beauty.</p>

<p>A person wandering through these secluded walks, or on the banks of the
various lakes and water falls, which adorn them, may here enjoy the
sweets of solitude and retirement, with equal composure, as if he was
far distant from the busy scenes that are close at hand.</p>

<p>What is here enumerated are all of them manufactured or carried on at
the Soho, at the present time:&mdash;steam engines of every description, and
for all purposes, where great power is requisite; coining of medals, or
medallions, of any size required; silver and plated articles, of every
description, such as tea urns, vases, tureens, dishes, candelabras, and
every necessary article to decorate the table or the drawing room;
metals of every description are here rolled, to any length or breadth
required; patent copying machines; fine polished steel fire irons; steel
buttons; ornaments for stove grates; fenders, or any other article in
steel, where taste and elegance are necessary.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Handsworth, in Staffordshire, distant two miles and a half</i>.  Leaving
Soho, you come to the elegant village of Handsworth, where, the common
lands of the parish being inclosed by act of parliament, in 1793, they
have probably been as productive, if not more so, than others of a
similar nature in any other part of the kingdom; for there are now at
least one hundred and fifty respectable houses erected upon the ground,
which, before it was inclosed, lay entirely waste; and plots of the same
land have been sold from two hundred pounds to a thousand pounds per
acre.</p>

<p>About one quarter of a mile distant from Soho, is the residence of Miss
Boulton, whose house is secluded from public view, by a lofty brick
wall; and half a mile farther, going down a lane, by the sign of the
Queen's head, a landscape of considerable interest exhibits itself;
including Soho, Birmingham, and the intermediate country, to the
monument. In the grounds, on the right, opposite the three mile stone,
is a grand picturesque view of the whole country, including Barr-beacon,
Aston church, and the lofty trees in the park. About half a mile
farther, you arrive at the verge of Sandwell park, a, seat belonging to
the Earl of Dartmouth, and opposite, on the left, is a grand panoramic
view of the country, including the ruins of Dudley castle.</p>

<p>The church is an ancient gothic stone building, dedicated to St. Mary,
with a square tower, of grey-stone; the body is of an irregular form,
the workmanship being rude and tasteless. It appears to be much
neglected, and out of repair, both inside and out; and neither in
respect to size or decorations, does it bear any analogy to the number
of the population, or the wealth of the parishioners. Indeed, if the
structure of the church should be a criterion to judge of the opulence
of the inhabitants, a stranger would certainly conclude, that they were
most of them tenants at rack rent, and greatly burdened with poor. The
only objects deserving of notice, are two monuments; one in the inside,
and the other on the out. The one erected to commemorate the late
Matthew Boulton, Esq. is the work of the celebrated Flaxman, and adds
another wreath of laurel to the brow of that classical artist. If is of
white and blue marble, and is surmounted by a bust, which is the best
representation extant of that enterprising and deserving man, to whose
memory it is sacred. The other is an humble tomb-stone, remarkable as
being one of the last works, cut by his own hand, with his name at the
top of it, of that celebrated typographer, Baskerville, but this, being
neglected by the relations of the deceased, has been mutilated, although
the inscription is still perfect, but so much overgrown with moss and
weeds, that it requires more discrimination than falls to the lot of
many passing travellers to discover the situation of this neglected gem.
To those who are curious, it will be found close to the wall,
immediately under the chancel window. This precious relic of that
eminent man is deserving of being removed, at the expense of the parish,
and preserved with the greatest care, withinside the church. Mr.
Baskerville was originally a stone-cutter, and afterwards kept a school,
in Birmingham.<a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor6">[6]</a><div class=note> Since writing the above, the Rev. T. L. Freer, who is
rector, and the wealthy parishioners have entered into a liberal
subscription, and being aided by government with the sum of five hundred
pounds, they have undertaken to rebuild the body of the church,
according to an elegant plan, designed by W. Hollins, statuary and
architect, of Birmingham, without making any rate on the inhabitants.</div><br>

<p>There is only one more of his cutting known to be in existence, and that
has lately been removed and placed withinside the church, at Edgbaston;
to which place please to refer.</p>

<p><i>West-Bromwich, in Staffordshire, distant five miles</i>.</p>

<p>The church is an old tower structure of stone, dedicated to St. Clement;
the body having been of late years rebuilt, has two side aisles,
handsomely pewed, and galleries all round. The officiating clergyman is
the Rev. Charles Townsend.</p>

<p>The waste lands in this parish being inclosed by act of parliament in
the year 1804, has produced a very beneficial effect; for, by the side
of the main road, which scarcely produced a blade of grass, there are
now numerous houses erected, and the lands about them are very
productive. The new inclosed lands now let from three pounds to five
pounds per acre, and a great part of it is in tillage.</p>

<p>In this extensive parish, the new inclosed land has been sold from one
hundred to eight hundred and forty pounds per acre; and the
neighbourhood is now become so populous, that it is in contemplation to
erect a new church, there being in the beginning of October last more
than three thousand pounds subscribed for that purpose.</p>

<p>The following works of considerable magnitude are, already established,
and now in full work:&mdash;</p>

Birmingham brass company, in Spon-lane.<br>
James Taylor, cast steel manufactory.<br>
Archibald Kenrick and Co. iron-founders.<br>
Samuel and John Dawes, iron and steel-masters.<br>
Izons and Whitehurst, foundry for kitchen furniture.<br>
Elwell and Hortons, iron-founders.<br>
Thomas Price, iron-master.<br>
Bagnall and Son, iron-masters.<br>
William Bullock and Co. iron-founders, and manufacturers<br>
of kitchen furniture, improved coffee mills, etc.<br>
Charles Bache, manufacturer of bar and sheet iron, old<br>
forge.<br>
William Chapman, grinder and polisher, Burstelholme mill.<br>
Samuel Elwell, iron-master, Friar-park forge,<br>
---- Tickell, iron-master.<br>
Isaac Horton, boiler-maker.<br>
Edward Fisher and Co. iron-masters.<br>
John U. Rastrick, manufacturer of steam engines.<br>

<p>Before you arrive at the six mile stone, the road divides, and you
proceed on the right hand for another mile, when, on a sudden, the eye
is highly gratified with a view of <i>Wednesbury</i>.  Which is erected on a
declivity; and on the summit, the church, with its lofty spire, makes a
very unusual and respectable appearance. This church is a beautiful
gothic edifice; the body and tower of which is coated with Parker's
cement, but the chancel remains as before. Tradition says, that on this
spot there was, in former times, a Saxon castle. Withinside the church
there are numerous ancient monuments, and an inscription, signifying that
William Hopkins, yeoman, Richard Hawkes, and Robert Carter, caused the
chimes of this church to be made and set up, at their equal and proper
cost and charges, A. D. 1635. The clock, which is represented to be a
remarkable good one, has a pendulum upon an unusual construction, the
rod being fourteen yards in length, and the ball of it weighs 100 pounds.</p>

<p>Here are eight musical bells, the two trebles being fixed in 1558; the
sixth has an inscription, &quot;William Comberford, lord of this manor, gave
this bell, 1623.&quot;&mdash;&quot;On the seventh is, Sancta Bartholomew, ora pro
nobis.&quot; And on the tenor is inscribed, &quot;I will sound and resound to
thee, O Lord, to call thy people to hear thy word.&quot;</p>

<p>The church yard is of considerable extent, and being in such an elevated
situation, those who profess to delineate panoramas may here find ample
scope to display their abilities; for there is not only a view of the
following churches, but the towns and villages wherein they are
situated, are several of them under the eye of the spectator from this
lofty eminence, viz. Walsall, Willenhall, Darlaston, Wolverhampton two
churches, Bilstone, Sedgley, Dudley, two churches and the ruins of the
castle, West-bromwich, Tipton, Wednesfield, Brierly-hill, and Rushall;
in addition to the above, by ascending the roof of the church, you
command Birmingham and Aston, together with numerous engines that are at
work in its vicinity; the whole when combined form such a rich and
variegated scene as probably cannot be equalled in any other situation.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Wednesbury there are numerous mines of coal, wherein
great numbers of people are employed, whilst others pursue the different
branches of gun-making; springs, steps, and other articles used by
coach-makers, are also manufactured here, together with wood screws,
hinges, and of late, apparatus for the gas lights.</p>

<p>In the year 1742, when the methodists were spreading their doctrines
through the kingdom, some disturbances took place here on that account;
and soon after, Mr. Wesley, the preacher, was waited upon by Sir John
Gonson, one of the Middlesex justices, who notified to him that he and
his brethren had received orders from above to do justice to him and his
friends, whenever they should make application; his majesty being
determined, that no man in his dominions should be persecuted for
conscience sake. Posterity will scarcely credit, that in Britain, and at
so late a period as 1742, justice was not to be obtained but by an order
from court; and that such order was issued, reflects infinite credit on
the sovereign, George 2d, who commanded it. This mandate was not by any
means premature; for it became absolutely necessary, to quell the
increasing tumults. In Staffordshire, the populace rose upon their
employers, from whom they demanded money, and if that was not complied
with, they threatened to serve them as they had done the methodists. A
quaker, when riding through Wednesbury, was attacked by them, pulled
from off his horse, and dragged to a coal pit, where it was attended
with difficulty to prevent their throwing him in. This gentleman, not
being so much attached to his principles as to refuse the protection of
the law, prosecuted them at the assizes, which caused those tumults to
subside in Staffordshire.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Darlaston</i>.</p>

<p>This place, being only one mile distant, I went there; but neither on
the road or in the village could I perceive any thing deserving of
attention; the inhabitants being employed in the same pursuits as at
Wednesbury.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Walsall, in Staffordshire, distant nine miles, on the direct road to
Stafford</i>.</p>

<p>You proceed down Snowhill, and having passed the buildings, you perceive
on the right hand Hunter's nursery grounds, from whence there is a good
prospect of the town of Birmingham, in a clear day. On the left, Hockley
abbey, and the plantations of Mr. Boulton, present a rich scene in
front, with a glass-house in the back ground. At the bottom of the hill
you cross a small stream of water, which separates Warwickshire from
the county of Stafford. In ascending the opposite hill, on the right
hand is Prospect-house, where the late Mr. Eginton carried on his
manufactory of stained glass. Soon after the road divides, when, turning
to the right hand, it leads you by a row of respectable houses, and when
through the toll gate, you leave what was once Handsworth common, and
immediately on the left is a handsome house, with a beautiful avenue of
lime trees; once the seat of the ancient family of Sacheverel, but now
the property of Joseph Grice, Esq.</p>

<p>A little farther on the right is a simple though tasteful lodge, leading
to Heathfield, the elegant mansion of the celebrated James Watt, Esq.
who is well known to all scientific men, for the great improvements he
has made in steam engines, and various other useful works. A few years
back, the adjacent ground was a wild and dreary waste, but it now
exhibits all the beauty and luxuriance that art assisted by taste can
give it. Woods and groves appear to have started up at command, and it
may now vie with any seat in the neighbourhood, for rural elegance and
picturesque beauty. Descending the hill, the parish church of Handsworth
presents itself to view, and a short distance before you arrive at it,
is the parsonage-house, where the Rev. Lane Freer resides.&mdash;It is a very
excellent house, and possesses more conveniences and luxuries than are
usually to be met with in the habitations of the clergy. About a mile
farther on the right is the elegant residence of N. G. Clarke, Esq. one
of the king's counsel; a gentleman highly distinguished for acuteness
and perspicuity in his profession, and thorough hospitality in his
house. Still farther on the left, as you descend a steep hill, there is
a fine view, at a considerable distance, of the domains of Hamstead
hall. It is a very elegant and modern-built mansion, the old one having
been taken down some years since, which was for many generations the
seat of the ancient and respectable family of the Wyrleys, who possessed
the manor and very large property in this parish. On the demise of the
late John Wyrley, Esq. the whole of this estate was left by will to
George Birch, Esq. at whose decease it devolved upon his only son, the
present Wyrley Birch, Esq. It is difficult to conceive a more beautiful
residence than this, as it contains all that hill and dale, wood and
water, aided by extensive views, can do, to make a place delightful and
desirable: these seem here to have been combined in the most beautiful
manner; for the river Tame meanders through this enchanting and
extensive domain; on whose banks are numerous groves of trees, and from
a solid rock there arises a lime tree, of unusual magnitude, whose
branches spreading in an horizontal direction became so heavy, and
injured the trunk to such a degree, that in order to preserve the body,
it not only became necessary to lop off the principal branches, but to
bind it together with iron in different ways, by hooping of it, and
passing a bar of iron through it, in the same manner as buildings are
frequently done, to preserve them. At the height of three feet, it
girths twenty-three feet and rises to the height of seventy feet. The
rock upon which this tree grows, is of such a nature, that there is a
grotto of considerable size cut in it, wherein the roots from this tree
spread themselves in different directions. This inestimable estate,
although for so many generations the patrimonial possessions of the
family, has been lately transferred by the proprietor to the Earl of
Dartmouth, and is now in the possession of William Wallis, Esq.</p>

<p>In the valley is a corn mill, worked by the river Tame, over which there
is a substantial bridge. Near the summit of the opposite hill, the road
passes close by the residence of Mr. Wren, who is well known in
Staffordshire, as an agriculturist. Near half a mile farther on the left
is an ancient white house, which has been occupied as a school for a
number of years. From the green opposite, if you face about, there is an
extensive view over the country; two of the Birmingham churches and the
monument being conspicuous objects. A very short distance farther is a
gravel pit, opposite to which is a rich and luxuriant view for a
considerable distance. At the finger post, two miles before you arrive
at Walsall, there is a beautiful landscape, and when you approach near
the town, by looking the contrary way, there is a rich and variegated
view over the country. A little before you enter the town, there are two
respectable houses, one on each side of the road; that on the left is
the residence of Mr. Richard Jesson, an attorney, and at the other,
which is built of stone, Mr. John Adams, a merchant, resides.</p>

<p>This road to Stafford is nearer by five miles than going through
Wolverhampton, and the accommodations are in every respect equal:
independant of that circumstance, whoever travels this road is not
incommoded by the numerous colleries and engines that are adjacent to
the other.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Walsall</i>.</p>

<p>This town, being considered a borough, by prescription for a number of
years, was incorporated by letters patent, bearing date 22d February, in
the 13th year of King Charles 2d; the government thereof is vested in a
mayor, with the assistance of twenty-four capital burgesses, who are
authorised to sue and are liable to be sued, by virtue of a common seal.
William Webb was appointed the first mayor, whose successor is to be
elected and sworn into office on the feast of St. Michael. The mayor and
his brethren are authorised to fix upon a recorder and town clerk, who
are empowered to hold a court of record, whenever it is requisite, to
determine any actions or pleas, for sums of money exceeding forty
shillings, and not more than twenty pounds. There are also two serjeants
at mace, who are under their directions; the late mayor, and one other
capital burgess, being in the commission of the peace for the borough
and foreign, they have authority to take cognizance of all crimes
committed within their jurisdiction, except conspiracy, murder, felony,
or any thing touching the loss of life. They are also empowered to have
a common prison, where all offenders may be detained, until discharged
by due course of law. By this charter, the mayor, recorder, and
twenty-four capital burgesses are exempt from serving upon any juries at
Stafford.</p>

<p>The seal of this corporation is three fleur de lis and three lions
quarterly, with two lions as supporters; over the arms is a crown
without an arch, and over the rim of the crown there are five fleur de
lis. It is nearly the size of a crown piece, with a latin inscription,
in very ancient characters. It is deposited with Joseph Stubbs, who is
town clerk, and steward of the manor to Lord Bradford. The arms of the
town appear to be a bear with a ragged staff.</p>

<p>The guildhall is situated in the High-street, one wing of which is the
Dragon inn, and the other is a large room where the corporation assemble
to transact business, and is called the mayor's parlour, under which is
the prison for the town.</p>

<p>The ancient wooden staves belonging to the corporation are still
deposited in the hall, and are curious relics of antiquity, being
ornamented with heads of various animals, rudely carved.</p>

<p>The sheriff of the county, by his deputy, holds a court in this town, at
the Castle inn, every third Monday, for the recovery of debts, under
forty shillings; but the expenses are excessive to both debtor and
creditor, and if the latter loses his cause, his expenses alone will
amount to six or seven pounds.</p>

<p>In the year 1452, Thomas Mosely, of Moxhull, in Warwickshire, being then
lord of Bascote, in that county, gave it in trust to William Lyle and
Thomas Magot, for the use of the town of Walsall. In 1539, the
inhabitants were summoned by the bellman to repair to the church, where
a dole was distributed, amounting to the sum of seven pounds, ten
shillings, and nine-pence. Some time after, an attempt was made to
discontinue this dole, which caused the populace to assemble, who forced
the same to be continued; at which time it was distributed to about
fourteen thousand people, nine thousand of whom were supposed to reside
in Walsall.</p>

<p>The church is a vicarage, dedicated to St. Matthew, or All Saints: it is
an ancient pile of building, singular in its appearance, being in the
form of a cross, the transept of which is composed by large side
chapels, whose roofs lie east and west, parallel to the body of the
church. The tower, which is situated at the south-west angle of the west
front, is strong, plain, and far from inelegant, being built with coarse
lime stone, on which a new spire was erected since 1775, when a set of
eight musical bells were fixed there, by Mr. Rudhall, of Glocester; the
weight of the tenor being more than twenty-three hundred, and the key
note E flat.</p>

<p>The following inscriptions are round the bells:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. &quot;When us you ring, we'll sweetly sing.&quot; </p>

<p>2. &quot;Fear God, honour the king.&quot; </p>

<p>3. &quot;Prosperity to the parish.&quot; </p>

<p>4. ditto ditto. </p>

<p>5. &quot;The Rev. John Darwall, vicar.&quot; </p>

<p>6. &quot;Thomas Rudhall, Glocester, founder.&quot; </p>

<p>7. &quot;Thomas Hector, Edward Licet, Thomas Overton, Deykin Hemming, church-wardens.&quot;</p>

<p>8. &quot;I to the church the living call, And to the grave do summon all.&quot;</p>

<p>The font of this church is alabaster, of an octagon form, with shields,
richly sculptured.</p>

<p>On each side of the chancel are eleven stalls, very entire, the seats of
which, being lifted up, exhibit a series of grotesque figures, curiously
carved, in bas relief; no two of which resemble each other. Over the
communion table is a large painting, representing the last supper.&mdash;The
vicarage, where the Rev. Philip Pratt resides, is in a delightful
situation, being on an eminence, and encompassed with lofty and majestic
trees.</p>

<p>There are three fairs in the year, viz. February 24th, Tuesday in the
whitsun week, and the Tuesday before St. Michael; at which time the
races take place, and have been for a number of years both numerously
and genteely attended; as a proof of it, the inhabitants in the year
1809 expended the sum of thirteen hundred pounds in the erection of a
grand stand; in the lower apartments of which is a billiard table, where
they resort for recreation. The fair at whitsuntide is not held by
charter, but being market day, at that holiday time is considered a fair
by prescription. There is in this town a charity school for twenty-four
boys and sixteen girls, who are all cloathed in blue: they are
instructed and cloathed gratis, but neither lodged nor boarded. The
expenses attending this school are defrayed by subscriptions, donations,
and sermons preached on the wake Sunday, which is the Sunday before St.
Michael. The school-room is near the George hotel. There is also a free
grammar school, near the church, founded by Queen Mary, in the first
year of her reign, which she endowed with certain lands that are vested
in trustees. The High-street is spacious, and therein are some
respectable shops, and a conduit for the use of the
inhabitants.&mdash;Park-street is also a wide one, but there are numerous low
houses in it.</p>

<p>The town has a singular appearance; its situation being upon a bold
eminence, from whose summit arises a fine old gothic church, with a
lofty spire, the streets and houses descending in every direction. In
the vicinity are numerous lime stone quarries, some of which are open
from the surface, and from others it is drawn up through a shaft,
similar to coal mines.</p>

<p>Mr. Siddons, the husband of the celebrated actress, was born in
Rushall-street, in this town, whilst his father kept a public-house,
known by the sign of the London apprentice, whose death was occasioned
by sparring or wrestling with a person named Denston. The present Mr.
Siddons was originally a barber, but having an inclination for the
stage, he joined the itinerant company of Mr. Kemble, and married one of
his daughters, who afterwards proved the heroine of the stage. Another
well-known character was also a native of this town, viz, Thomas Haskey,
the celebrated ventriloquist, who was by trade a bridle bit maker; but
whilst an apprentice he left his master, and entered into the army,
where he lost a leg and obtained a pension. When young, he did not know
the abilities he possessed, but hearing O'Burn, he endeavoured to
imitate him; and when Mr. Stanton's company of performers were at
Walsall, he repeatedly from the gallery entertained the audience by sham
dialogues, in two voices, between himself and Tommy. He was an ignorant
man, but possessing this unusual faculty, he was frequently sent for by
Lord Dudley, to entertain the company at Himley, upon which occasions,
he always hired a post chaise to convey him there. He afterwards went to
London, and performed at Sadler's Wells in the year 1796, and when his
benefit came on, he cleared &pound;200.</p>

<p>About one mile from the town, on the road to Wolverhampton, is a strong
chalybeate water, called Alum well.</p>

<p>About one mile and a half from Walsall, near to Bentley hall, at a place
called Pouck hill, as some workmen were opening a quarry, they
discovered numerous basaltic columns, some of which are from four to
five feet in diameter, of various lengths, some singularly waved, others
straight; some of the joints short and others extend to the length of
five or six feet: they lie nearly in an horizontal position, and
resemble at a distance large trees piled one upon another.</p>

<p>The chief articles manufactured in this town and its vicinity are bridle
bitts, stirrups, spurs and other articles either used or sold by the
saddlers.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Barr Park, distant five miles, on the road to Walsall</i>.</p>

<p>The hospitable mansion of Sir Joseph Scott, Bart, is surrounded by a
park of considerable extent, wherein there is the greatest variety of
undulating hills and dales, wood and water, together with such extensive
views, as can only be found in this part of the kingdom. To this park
there are three entrances, and at every avenue the worthy proprietor has
erected an elegant lodge, from whence there are capacious carriage roads
to the mansion. One of these lodges is about five miles on the road to
Walsall, to which you approach by taking the right hand road, opposite a
house of entertainment, the Scott's arms, and then taking the second
turning to the left conducts you to the lodge. On entering the park, a
circular coach drive leads to the holly wood, through which you proceed
by a serpentine road near half a mile, when a beautiful sheet of water
presents itself to view, along whose banks you pass near a mile before
you arrive at the mansion.</p>

<p>The situation of the building is low in front of the water, but being
screened by rising ground and lofty trees, it must be very warm in the
winter. On the left of the house, a walk leads you to the flower garden,
which is laid out with great taste, containing flowers and small shrubs
of the choicest and rarest kinds, together with a fountain in the
centre. From hence there are delightful views, and among others over the
adjacent country, Birmingham is distinctly seen. At the distance of
about two miles farther, towards Walsall, there is another lodge, which
is the entrance from Walsall, and leads you by a spacious serpentine
road through the Marrian wood, which is composed of various shrubs and
evergreens, and conducts you to a most elegant chapel, with a beautiful
and well-proportioned spire, underneath which you enter into one of the
most sumptuous places of worship in the universe. There are in the whole
eleven lofty windows, and seven of them are ornamented in the most
elegant manner with stained glass, by Eginton: they are all full length
figures, large as life, with their proper attributes. The first
represents Fortitude, the second Temperance, the third Justice, in the
fourth, which is over the communion table, is the apotheosis of a child,
after the Rev. Mr. Peters, the fifth represents Hope, the sixth Charity,
and the seventh Prudence. The pews and every other part correspond,
there being a sumptuous organ, with a gallery in front of it, which
extends on each side, before two windows. In a spacious cemetary there
are some tombs, much more elegant than are usually met with; there is
also a yew tree of large dimensions, which is grown much higher than
trees of that species do in general, and also some venerable elms,
together with the village school. Close adjoining is another lodge, and
the road from it conducts you over an elegant bridge, on the right of
which is a cascade.</p>

<p>There is also another lodge, at a place called the Quieslet, about six
miles on the road to Barr-beacon, where a spacious road conducts you for
a considerable distance, by a plantation of oaks, and so through the
park, wherein there are fixed numerous seats, which command delightful
and comprehensive prospects, and among others may be seen the extensive
sheet of water in the vale, backed by a grand screen of venerable oaks
and verdant hills; at same time, from amidst the nearer trees and
shrubs, the house appears to emerge, and adds considerably to the scene.
From the various knolls with which this park abounds, there are several
that command a view of Birmingham, and also of the woods in Sandwell
park.</p>

<p>There is also a view of the ruins of Dudley castle, and from another
eminence the churches of Wolverhampton and Wednesbury are seen, with the
elegant spire of Barr chapel in front. From the lodge at the approach
from Walsall there is an extensive view over the country, bounded in the
horizon, to the left by Dudley castle, the Rowley hills, etc. and to the
right by the Wrekin and other mountains in Shropshire.</p>

<p><i>To Dudley, in Worcestershire, through West-bromwich, ten miles on the
road to Stourbridge</i>.</p>

<p>You proceed down Snowhill, pass by the Soho, through Handsworth and
West-bromwich, and along the Wolverhampton road, near six miles, when
the road divides, and you take to the left, having the ruins of Dudley
castle full in view. After crossing the Birmingham canal, you come to
<i>Tipton, eight miles</i>.</p>

<p>In this parish the following works are carried on in an extensive
manner:&mdash;</p>

Blair and Stevenson, soap and lead.<br>
Harrison, Oliver, and Co. Horsley iron-works.<br>
Walker and Co. Gospel-oak iron-works.<br>
Dixon, Turton, and Co. have three furnaces.<br>
Round, Caddick, and Co. Old church forge.<br>
Messrs. Parkers, iron-masters.<br>
Zephaniah Parkes and Co. iron-masters.<br>
Messrs. Willets, iron-masters.<br>
Birmingham Co. iron-masters.<br>
Bagnall and Co. iron-masters.<br>
Moat colliery.<br>
Horsley ditto.<br>
New Church ditto.<br>
Tibbington ditto.<br>
Glebe Land ditto.<br>
Ockerhill ditto.<br>
Puppy Green ditto.<br>
Dudley Port ditto.<br>
Birmingham Co. ditto.<br>
Brookhouse ditto.<br>

<p>The church is dedicated to St. Lawrence, of which the Rev. James Bevan
is perpetual curate. From hence you pass by the Dudley brewery, and
having ascended the hill, arrive at
<i>Dudley, ten miles</i>.</p>

<p>In this town there are two parish churches, one of which is dedicated to
St. Thomas, and is now rebuilding in a magnificent manner, to which a
lofty spire is attached; it being in height 170 feet, and therein are
ten musical bells: of this church the Rev. Luke Booker, L.L.D. is vicar.
The other is dedicated to St. Edmund, wherein a free gallery has been
erected by subscription; over which the Rev. Proctor Robinson presides.</p>

<p>The different sects of presbyterians, baptists, quakers, methodists, and
independants, have each of them their respective places of worship.</p>

<p>There is a free school, founded by King Edward 6th, two national
schools, on the plan of Dr. Bell, and one Lancasterian ditto. The
inhabitants who have a taste for reading, have established a library,
wherein there are more than three thousand volumes.</p>

<p>There are here five glass houses, two of which belong to Messrs. T. and
G. Hawkes, where the most superb articles are manufactured; another to
Mr. John Roughton; a fourth to Price, Cook, Wood, and Co.; and the fifth
is at Holly-hall, belonging to Zephaniah Parkes and Co.</p>

<p>There are also the following iron-works established:&mdash;</p>

Zephaniah Parkes and Co.<br>
Messrs. Attwoods, three furnaces.<br>
Glazebrook and Whitehouse.<br>
Salisbury, Hawkes, and Co.<br>
---- Banks.<br>
Wainwright, Jones, and Co.<br>

<p>At the priory, there is a powerful steam engine, belonging to Mr.
Benson; and on the road to Birmingham is a brewery, belonging to a
public company. In the environs are numerous mines of coal, ironstone,
and lime; which land, where the mines have not been worked, sells in
general for about one thousand pounds per acre.&mdash;Nails and heavy
iron-work employ a great part of the population.</p>

<p>The ancient castle, of which there still remains the keep and the
gateway, is said to have been erected about the year 700, by a person
named Dodo, from whom the name of the town is derived. Underneath the
hill, whereon the castle was situated, there are stupendous caverns,
from whence the lime stone has been conveyed away, which are truly
august, being of considerable extent, and proportionably high; the roof
being supported by rude pillars of vast dimensions, which have been left
by the miners for that purpose. There is one tunnel that perforates the
hill entirely, being in length near two miles: it is in height thirteen
feet, in width nine feet, and in one part sixty-four feet below the
surface.</p>

<p>These enormous subterranean works, with the method of procuring the
stone, are highly deserving the attention of strangers, who have there
an opportunity of seeing this useful article forced from its natural
situation by means of gunpowder; raised from the bowels of the earth,
and conveyed through the country by means of inland navigation, to serve
the purpose of the agriculturist, and also the architect. In these rocks
there are numerous marine productions, and among others, one which the
miners denominate a locust, for which they have been known to refuse its
weight in gold; it being understood that there is only one other place
in the kingdom where they are to be found. The mines of coal in this
vicinity are from ten to twelve yards in thickness, which circumstance
it is said does not take place in any other part of the kingdom. A
stranger approaching Dudley after it is dark, will be astonished to see
the numerous fires in different directions, which proceed from the
furnaces, forges, and collieries; the latter converting their small coal
into coke.</p>

<p>The noble proprietor of these extensive mines and the ruins above them
has for several successive years planted innumerable trees of different
kinds around the castle hill, and during last summer (1818) he caused
avenues to be cut through them, which form the most romantic,
picturesque, and diversified shady walks, extending over numerous hills
and dales, that can be imagined; the views that occasionally present
themselves when least expected, are enchanting, and when you arrive at
the summit, there is a most extensive prospect over the counties of
Worcester, Stafford, Derby, Leicester, Warwick, Salop, Hereford, and
part of Wales: it is not only extensive, but full of variety, comprising
hills and dales, woods and villages, populous towns, and busy seats of
manufacture; a scene that may be justly termed, of various view, warm
and alive with human habitations.&mdash;From this eminence eighteen churches
are discernable; viz, those of Dudley, Birmingham, West-bromwich,
Walsall, Rushall, Wednesbury, Darlaston, Tipton, Bilston, Wednesfield,
Wolverhampton, Sedgley, Briery-hill, Oldswinford, and Pedmore; also the
fine obelisk and castle at Hagley; the elegant seat of Lord Westcote;
Envil, the admired seat of Lord Stamford; and part of the woods at
Himley, the spacious and beautiful seat of the humane, generous, and
noble proprietor of these ruins. The stupendous mountains of Malvern
(though near forty miles distant), bounding the horizon towards the
south, are grand and noble features in the scene; as are also those of
Clent, Abberley, the Cleys, and the Wrekin;</p>

&quot;Mountains, on whose barren breast<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The lab'ring clouds do often rest.&quot;</span><br>

<p><i>To Dudley, in Worcestershire, through Oldbury, distant</i> <i>nine miles.</i></p>

<p>Having passed the Sand-pits and Spring-hill, you cross the Birmingham
canal and enter upon what was Birmingham heath, which being inclosed in
the year 1800, was found to contain 289 acres, which land now lets from
thirty to fifty shillings per acre.</p>

<p>On the right hand is a boat-builder's yard, and on the left a
glass-house, belonging to Messrs. Biddle and Lloyd. Proceeding towards
the windmill, you perceive at a short distance on the right hand another
glass-house, belonging to Messrs. Shakespear and Fletcher. Ascending the
hill, there is on the right an extensive view over the adjacent
country, including Barr-beacon, Mr. Boulton's plantations, and
Winson-green, a neat house, in the possession of Mrs. Steward. On the
left is Summerfield-house, late the residence of John Iddins, Esq. but
now of James Woolley, Esq. and beyond it, a neat white house, occupied
by Mr. Hammond. Over an apparently wooded country, you have a windmill
in full view, and when at the foot of the hill, on the right is
Smethwick grove, the residence of John Lewis Moilliet, Esq.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">

<p>You now enter Smethwick, which is in Staffordshire, and ascending the
hill, a neat brick house makes its appearance on the right hand, where
John Reynolds, Esq. resides, who, by succeeding to what was considered
by Mr. Lane, his predecessor, to be a worn out trade, accumulated a
considerable fortune, and has retired from business to enjoy it near
twenty years. At the summit of the hill on the left is Shireland hall,
which is now converted into a seminary for young ladies, under the
superintendance of Miss Marmont.</p>

<p>There are in Smethwick some works of considerable magnitude, viz.
Messrs. Boulton and Watt's manufactory for steam engines; an extensive
soap work, belonging to Messrs. Adkins and Nock; a manufactory of brass,
under the denomination of the Smethwick brass company; and also one of
British crown glass, belonging to Thomas Shutt and Co. There is a house
called the Beakes, where Wm. Wynne Smith, Esq. resides.</p>

<p>The place of worship is a chapel of ease to the parish of Harborne, and
is a neat modern brick tower building, of a single pace, lofty and
coved, about sixty feet by twenty-four, and well paved, with a gallery
at the west end. The present incumbent is the Rev. Edward Dales, who
resides in the neat parsonage-house on the south side of the chapel
yard.</p>

<p>Leaving Smethwick, you proceed towards Oldbury, upon which road the
trustees are making great improvements, by widening the road and turning
the course of a brook, over which they are building a bridge, which when
finished will be a great accommodation. This village is situated in the
county of Salop, and is a chapel of ease to Halesowen. A new
court-house was erected here in the year 1816, where the court of
requests is held once a fortnight. The protestant dissenters have here a
neat place of worship, as have also the methodists. Close to the village
are several coal mines, and a blast furnace, belonging to Mr. Parker.<a name="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor7">[7]</a><div class=note> From this place you have an excellent view of Rowley hills,
the ruins of Dudley castle, and the fine woods in Sandwell park.</div><br>

<p>About a mile distant, on the left of the road is the Brades, where
Messrs. William Hunt and Sons have established a considerable
manufacture of iron and steel, which they form into scythes, hay knives,
trowels, and every kind of hoe now in use.  This road from Birmingham
to Dudley is at least one mile nearer than going through West-bromwich,
and in my opinion will be sufficiently commodious for the traffic there
is between the two towns. The distance is only nine miles, and in
travelling that short space of ground you are in four different
counties; Birmingham being in Warwickshire; Smethwick, in Staffordshire;
Oldbury, in Shropshire; and Dudley in the county of Worcester.</p>

<p>N. B. Since writing the above, the bridge is completed, and the whole
line of road improved to a considerable degree.</p>

<p><i>To Hockley-house, ten miles, on the road to Stratford-upon-Avon and
also to Warwick.</i></p>

<p>You proceed through Deritend, up Camp-hill, and when near the summit,
there is on the right hand an ancient brick building, called the
Ravenhurst, the residence of Mr. John Lowe, attorney, who is equally
respectable in his profession, as the house is in appearance. A short
distance beyond on the left is Fair-hill, where Samuel Lloyd, Esq.
resides, and on the opposite side of the road is the Larches, the abode
of Wm. Withering, Esq.&mdash;This house, when it belonged to Mr. Darbyshire,
was known by the name of Foul Lake, but when Dr. Priestley resided
there, he gave it the name of Fair-hill; afterwards, being purchased by
Dr. Withering, he altered the name of it to the Larches. Having passed
through the turnpike, on the left is Sparkbrook-house, John Rotton, Esq.
resident. At the distance of one mile and a half the road to Warwick
branches off to the left, and on the summit of the hill is
Spark-hill-house, inhabited by Miss Morris. Opposite the three mile
stone is a very neat pile of building, called Green-bank-house, where
Benjamin Cooke, Esq. has taken up his abode. A little beyond, at a place
called the Coal-bank, there is a free school, which is endowed with
about forty pounds per annum.</p>

<p>At a short distance on the left is Marston chapel, which is usually
called Hall-green chapel: it was erected and endowed by Job Marston,
Esq. of Hall-green hall, with about ninety acres of land, and other
donations.</p>

<p>At the distance of five miles, you pass through a village called Shirley
Street; and at the distance of another fire miles, you arrive at
Hockley-house; a place of entertainment, where travellers of every
denomination are accommodated in a genteel manner, and on reasonable
terms. About one mile from hence, on the road to Stratford, is
Umberslade, or Omberslade, where the Archer family were used to reside,
but it is now untenanted.</p>

<p><i>From Hockley-house to Warwick, ten miles.</i></p>

<p>At the distance of one quarter of a mile, there is on the right a view
of Lapworth church, and on the left is Pack wood-house, which is at
present unoccupied. At Rowington, the Warwick canal is carried at an
immense expense over a deep valley, and also through a tunnel of
considerable length; on the left is the village church, to which you
ascend by steps cut in the solid rock, and near to it is the handsome
residence of Samuel Aston, Esq. from hence you proceed through Hatton to
Warwick.</p>

<p><i>To Warwick, twenty miles</i>&mdash;<i>Leamington, twenty-two miles.</i></p>

<p>You proceed through Deritend and Bordesley, continuing upon the
Stratford road for one mile and a half, when you turn to the left; and
at the distance of two miles there is a view over a well-wooded country,
with the spire of Yardley church on the left. At Acock's-green there is
a prospect nearly similar; and in a field, opposite the five mile stone,
there is an extensive picturesque landscape, with a sheet of water in
front, which covers about thirty acres;<a name="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> in the midst of which is a
small island, with some trees upon it, that adds considerably to the
scene.</p>

<a name="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor8">[8]</a><div class=note> This sheet of water is the reservoir of the Warwick canal.</div><br>

<p><i>Solihull, distant seven miles.</i></p>

<p>This beautiful, neat, and clean village had at one time a market, but
that has been discontinued for a long time. There are still three fairs
annually; one on the 29th of April, another on the 11th of September,
and the third on the 12th of October. There are here several genteel and
commodious houses; the vicinity being very respectable. The, church is
an ancient gothic pile of building, with an elegant spire. The Rev.
Charles Curtis is rector.</p>

<p>Leaving the village, on the right you pass by Malvern-hall, the
residence of H.G. Lewis, Esq. and afterwards arrive at Balsall Temple,
which in former days belonged to the knights templars, and at their
dissolution the knights hospitallers became possessed of it, in whom it
remained till the general dissolution of the abbies. It was afterwards
converted into an hospital, for the reception of indigent women, either
unmarried or widows, to be selected from Balsall and Long Itchington, in
Warwickshire, Trentham, in Staffordshire, or Lillenhall, in Shropshire.
This institution is now in great prosperity, the annual income amounting
to near &pound;1500; the number of its alms-women is at present thirty. The
buildings are extensive and substantial, forming a complete square, and
healthfully situated on the verge of a spacious and fertile green. The
trustees are the bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, together with the
Earls of Warwick and Aylesford, assisted by other respectable gentlemen
in the county, who have placed the whole institution under the immediate
charge of a master, with a salary of &pound;150. per annum, who is at this
time the Rev. J. Short.</p>

<p>To those who admire antiquity, Balsall church will be a pleasing
object, as it now remains nearly in the same state as it was when first
erected, about seven hundred years back. Its dimensions are one hundred
and two feet long, thirty-eight broad, and fifty-seven high. At the east
and west ends are lofty windows, extending from the roof nearly to the
ground, and on each side are three noble windows. The heads of all the
windows are ornamented with beautiful tracery, and no two of them
resemble each other. There are no divisions withinside, and what
distinguishes the chancel from the body of the church is an ascent of
three steps. The walls are very substantial, and so clustered with ivy,
that it forces its way through any small fissures into the interior.
Over the west door there is a low turret, and below the cornice is a row
of ten heads, in a good state of preservation, which are considered to
be of excellent workmanship.</p>

<p>Near the church is the ancient hall of the templars, formerly a splendid
apartment, but now it is converted into a barn, which is represented to
have been one hundred and forty feet in length.</p>

<p>A little farther is Springfield, the elegant and delightful mansion of
Joseph Boultbee, Esq. and at a short distance is Knowle, which is a
small old town, on elevated ground, in the midst of fertile fields. This
church is of considerable size, and exhibits marks of antiquity in its
remains of stained glass and grotesque carved work.</p>

<p>Not far from hence is Baddesley-Clinton-hall, the seat of Edward
Ferrers, Esq. and about one mile beyond is a small inn, known by the
name of Tom o'Bedlam, near to which is a venerable oak tree, supposed to
be two hundred years old, measuring in girth twenty yards, from which
one branch extends across a road thirty feet wide. You next come to
Wroxhall abbey, the residence of Christopher Wren, Esq. a descendant
from the noted Sir Christopher Wren, who erected St. Paul's cathedral,
in London. The church of Wroxhall is an ancient structure, forming one
side of a square, the buildings of the abbey forming the other three
sides. The windows, which are ornamented with stained glass, are
remarkably fine: the two figures of Moses and Aaron are admired, not
only for the drapery, but also for the splendid colours.</p>

<p>About one mile before you arrive at Hatton, there is to the left a
pleasant view over a well-wooded country, in the midst of which the
ivied towers and magnificent battlements of Kenilworth castle present
themselves to view. Hatton is a small village over which the celebrated
and learned Dr. Parr presides. At Hatton-hill, near the two mile stone,
there is an extensive and diversified prospect over the fertile tract
that surrounds Warwick; in every part highly cultivated, and adorned
with woods, encircled by gently-rising hills; and in the back ground are
seen Shuckburgh-hill on one side and Edge-hill on the other.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Warwick</i>.  This ancient town is seated on a rock, to which you ascend
in every direction, there being four avenues; one from Birmingham,
another from Stratford, a third from Coventry, and a fourth from
Banbury. The eminence on which the town is erected is itself encircled
by hills at the distance of from two to three miles, which bound the
prospect in every direction, except to the N.E. where you may see into
Northamptonshire, and to the S.W. where the eye ranges over an extensive
country, backed by the hills in Glocestershire and Worcestershire. The
surrounding country is very fruitful, being cultivated with great care,
and the enclosures separated by beautiful hedges, which are richly
adorned with trees in a flourishing condition, and also by the river
Avon, which meanders here in a considerable stream, and near Warwick is
augmented by the junction of the Leam. The town being seated on a dry
eminence, is exposed to the genial influence of the sun, which rarifies
the air, and renders the atmosphere so salubrious and warm, that in its
vicinity the seasons are frequently earlier by a fortnight than they are
at the distance of twenty or thirty miles. The four principal streets
cross each other at right angles, and lead to the cardinal points.</p>

<p>Great improvements have of late been made in them, by the introduction
of culverts, repaving the carriage roads, and laying the footpaths with
flags. Lamps are lighted during the winter months, at the expense of the
corporation, who have in a commendable manner widened the narrow parts
of some streets, and removed numerous obstructions; which gives an air
of liveliness to this once sleepy town, and the inhabitants, being
rowsed from their lethargy, are now become active and industrious.&mdash;The
canal from Birmingham comes to this town, from whence it is continued to
Napton, where it unites with the Oxford, and by means of it, with the
grand junction canal.</p>

<p>The town is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, and twelve principal
burgesses, with a town clerk and a recorder, who are empowered to make
laws for the regulation of the borough, and upon all offenders to impose
reasonable fines and penalties. Here are two manufactories of cotton,
one of lace, and one of worsted, all of them upon an extensive scale,
which contribute considerably to the cheerful activity and increasing
population. There are here held twelve fairs annually; the market, which
is well supplied, is on a Saturday; the quarter sessions for the county,
and also the assizes.&mdash;The horse races take place in September, and a
second meeting of the same kind is held in November. This borough sends
two members to parliament, who are elected by those who pay scot and
lot; the number of electors being about five hundred.</p>

<p>Here are two churches; one dedicated to St. Mary and the other to St.
Nicholas: there, are also places of worship for presbyterians, quakers,
independants, baptists, and Wesleyans.</p>

<p>In the vicinity, the following places are deserving of attention:&mdash;Guy's
cliff, the ruins of Kenilworth castle, Stoneleigh abbey,
Charlcott-house, and Combe abbey. Passing over the new bridge, on the
road to Leamington, there is a grand picturesque view of Warwick; there
being in the foreground the rich meadows, with the Avon meandering
through them, the church of St. Nicholas, and the trees behind, which
form a dark shade. Near to it is the castellated entrance into the
castle, and the elegant tower of St. Peter's chapel. On the right is the
priory, with its beautiful woods. The town is perceptible in the centre,
with the tower of St. Mary's, which rises above the variegated and
extensive groves of the castle. On the left is the principal object, the
castle, which raises its lofty embattled towers over the shady groves
with which it is surrounded. The elegant bridge, whose span is 105 feet,
is a prominent feature in the landscape.</p>

<p>On the road leading to Tachbrook, about one mile from the town, the eye
is gratified with a rich and luxuriant landscape, wherein appears the
church of St. Nicholas, the priory, the hospital of St. John, the tower
of St. Mary's church, and, to crown the whole, the castle.</p>

<p>The walks and rides in the vicinity of this town present innumerable
objects deserving of attention, and whoever takes delight in rural
scenery, may here be amply gratified.</p>

<p>In addition to these works, there is a considerable manufactory of hats,
and an iron-foundry; to which may be added a corn mill, wherein are five
pair of stones, and three of them constantly in motion, by which means
they are enabled to grind and dress three hundred bushels of flour
every day.</p>

<p><i>The County Hall.</i></p>

<p>This is an elegant pile of building, with a stone front, ornamented with
pillars of the Corinthian order, to which, the ascent is by a flight of
steps, through folding doors, into a noble room of just proportions,
being ninety-four feet in length and thirty-six in breadth. At each end
are semicircular recesses, surmounted by cupolas, and fitted up with
convenient galleries, where the two courts of justice are held; the
criminal court being on the right, and that for civil causes on the
left; between which there is accommodation for the servants and
attendants upon the court. Above there is an apartment where the petit
juries occasionally retire, and adjoining it is the room where the grand
jury assemble. The quarter sessions for the county are also held in this
hall, and in it all county meetings are convened. During the races there
is a temporary boarded floor laid down, and the hall is converted into a
ball-room, the two recesses being fitted up for card parties: the
pillars with which it is ornamented are encircled with wreaths of lamps,
and what was before the solemn court of justice, is now converted into a
brilliant and sportive scene, where gaiety and fashion take place of
their predecessors.</p>

<p><i>The Court House.</i></p>

<p>This spacious and elegant pile of building is appropriated to the use
of the body corporate, there being two rooms on the ground floor; that
on the right is where the mayor and aldermen hold their assemblies, and
the other is fitted up as a court, where the sessions are held for the
borough. On the second floor, there is a commodious, well-proportioned
apartment, sixty feet by twenty-seven, which is fitted up in an elegant
manner with superb cut-glass chandeliers of large dimensions, at one end
of which is an orchestra and also a card room adjoining. In this room
annual entertainments are given by the mayor, and public meetings for
the borough are convened. In it public lectures upon any particular
subject are occasionally delivered, and it is also sometimes used as a
ballroom.</p>

<p><i>The Market House.</i></p>

<p>This substantial building does credit to the town; it being very
convenient for those who bring the produce of their farms to market. The
upper apartments are made use of as store-rooms for the arms and
accoutrements of the military within the county. From its summit there
is a fine view of the town, and also a prospect of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p><i>The Stone Bridge</i>.</p>

<p>This elegant structure, which is erected across the river Avon, consists
of one arch, measuring 105 feet in the span, at the expense of four
thousand pounds: one thousand was contributed by the corporation, and
the remainder was defrayed by the Earl of Warwick.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>The Iron Bridge</i>.</span><br>

<p>The rock whereon this town is erected being cut away, to make a road
into it twenty-four feet wide, Charles Mills, Esq. one of the members
for the borough, caused an iron bridge to be erected at his expense,
across this road, and thereby formed a junction between the marketplace
and the Saltsford.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Theatre</i>.</p>

<p>The town not being very extensive, this building was erected to
correspond with the population: it is no ways remarkable in its external
appearance, but it is fitted up in a neat and convenient manner within,
and is always opened during the races.</p>
<br>

<p><i>College School</i>.</p>

<p>This ancient pile of building is of considerable size, and in it the
native children of the parish, who think proper to take advantage of the
institution, are educated free of expense; but as the course of
instruction is prescribed to the learned languages only, its utility as
a free school for general education is very contracted. The salary of
the master, who must be a clergyman of the established religion, is
seventy-five pounds, and he having but little employment, has an
assistant, who receives annually thirty pounds, exclusive of other
emoluments. To this school two estates were left in trust, to provide
two exhibitions of seventy pounds each, for two young men, natives of
the town, towards defraying the expense of their education, at Oxford,
for the space of seven years.</p>

<p>There is also a public library, wherein is a considerable collection of
well-chosen books, chiefly of modern literature; but the building that
contains it is not deserving of notice.</p>

<p>The charitable donations and benefactions that have been left to this
town are very numerous, and amount to a large sum of money.</p>

<p>Here are six different alms-houses, one school wherein thirty-nine boys
are taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, and thirty-six girls are
instructed in reading, writing, sewing, and knitting. There is also a
school of industry, and four sunday schools. A lying-in charity is also
established here, for the relief of poor married women, residing within
the borough, who each of them are accommodated with a set of child-bed
linen for one month, one pound of candles, one pound of soap, and during
the winter months, with two hundred weight of coals. They are also
provided with a sufficient quantity of caudle, together with proper
attendants, and all necessary medical advice. In addition to the
before-mentioned there are two poor-houses.</p>

<p>There is also a very ancient building, denominated Leicester's hospital,
for the reception of twelve indigent men, who are termed brethren,
together with a master, who must be a clergyman of the established
church, and in preference to all others, if he offers himself, the vicar
of St. Mary's. It is endowed with land, which at the time was valued at
&pound;200 per annum, but now amounts to near &pound;2000, exclusive of the vicarage
of Hampton-in-Arden, which is in the gift of the brethren, who usually
bestow it upon the master. It had long been ascertained that the clear
annual rental of the estate far exceeded all that could be required for
the support of the number of brethren in the hospital, and that the
salary of the master was fixed at fifty pounds per annum.</p>

<p>In the year 1813, this important business was brought before parliament,
when it appeared, that each of the brethren received, clear of all
deductions, about &pound;130 per year each, which sum the act leaves them in
the possession of; but it provides, as vacancies occur, either by death
or otherwise, on the admission of every new member, his annual income
shall not exceed &pound;80, and that the surplus &pound;50 shall one half of it go
to the increase of the master's salary, until it amounts to &pound;400 per
annum, and the remainder is to form a fund for the support of ten
additional members. The qualification for admission being now fixed at
&pound;50 per annum: no candidate is to be possessed of an income exceeding
that. Adjoining to the hospital is a chapel, which is neatly fitted up
for the use of the brethren, the master, and his family, who daily
assemble there for morning and evening prayer, except on those days when
service is performed at St. Mary's, where their attendance is then
required.</p>
<br>

<p><i>St. Mary's Church</i>.</p>

<p>This stately building taken altogether makes a very respectable
appearance, particularly the tower, wherein are eight bells and a set
of chimes; what is very remarkable, the principal entrance into the
church is under the tower; therefore it admits of a grand view down the
middle aisle, which being terminated by the east window, is seen to
great advantage. There is in this church an excellent organ, and
numerous monuments, but none of them any ways remarkable. From the south
transept of this church, you descend by a flight of steps to St. Mary's
chapel, and enter therein by folding doors, which, when opened, the eye
is astonished upon viewing the interior of this beautiful and
magnificent structure, which is considered to be as fine a specimen of
gothic architecture as any in the kingdom, it being in the pointed style
of the middle order. This chapel, having been twenty-one years in
building, was finished in the year 1464, and including the monument
erected to commemorate the Earl of Warwick, cost &pound;2481, an amazing sum
at that period. In the chapel there are five sumptuous monuments.</p>
<br>

<p><i>St. Nicholas's Church</i>.</p>

<p>This incongruous pile of building is of modern date, being opened for
divine service on the 17th September, 1780.</p>

<p><i>County Gaol.</i></p>

<p>This extensive, substantial, and commodious pile of building is of solid
stone, and in all respects so complete, that every purpose it was
intended to answer is fully accomplished. The area of this prison
contains near an acre of ground, which is surrounded by a wall
twenty-three feet high, and of proportionate strength.</p>
<br>

<p><i>County Bridewell.</i></p>

<p>This building is of stone, and contains numerous apartments, in every
one of which there is a glazed window and an iron door, the sleeping
rooms being furnished with iron bedsteads and chaff beds, with two rugs
to each. A donation is made to every prisoner, on being released,
according to the distance he is from home and behaviour during
confinement. One or two shirts or shifts, a pair of shoes, or a jacket,
are presented to those who have been in prison six months.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Castle.</i></p>

<p>The necessary limits to which this work is confined, will not admit of
describing that magnificent and sumptuous pile of building; therefore
those who are desirous of seeing a description of it, are referred to
the local historian.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Priory.</i></p>

<p>This ancient edifice is in the immediate vicinity of Warwick: it was
originally a complete square, three sides of which still remain, the
fourth having been removed.&mdash;The western side appears to have been part
of the ancient chapel, there still remaining part of the baptismal
font, which is of stone, richly ornamented, and is highly deserving the
attention of an antiquarian.</p>

<p>It is situated on a pleasing eminence, embosomed in the ancient and
majestic groves, surrounded by delightful gardens and an extensive park,
and presents such a beautiful sylvan scene as is rarely to be met with.
The undulated surface of the ground, intermingled with numerous sheets
of water, are richly adorned with trees of various kinds, of vigorous
growth and the most beautiful forms, among which the elm and the chesnut
are particularly conspicuous. Through this park there are several
footpaths open to the public, and are the most rural and delightful
walks imaginable.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Guy's Clift</i>.</p>

<p>Leland, the antiquarian, who wrote in the time of Henry 8th, speaking of
this delightful and romantic place, says, &quot;It is the abode of pleasure,
and a place delightful to the muses: there are natural cavities in the
rocks, small but shady groves, clear and chrystal streams, flowery
meadows, mossy caves, a gentle murmuring river running among the rocks,
and to crown all, solitude and quiet, friendly in so high a degree to
the muses.&quot;</p>

<p>The approach to this romantic place is from the Coventry road, by the
side of shady plantations, until you arrive at a lofty stone arch,
through which you enter the court yard, the whole of which is hewn out
of the solid rock, and underneath there are subterraneous passages and
cellars, wherein the atmospheric air produces so little effect, that
during the heats of summer or the colds in winter the thermometer only
varies one degree. In this court there are numerous stables excavated
out of the solid rock, as are some of the lower apartments of the house,
which is an elegant modern mansion, and near to it is the ancient
chapel, with its embattled towers and gothic windows, as it was
originally built in the reign of Henry 6th, and is still in good repair.
Those who admire the productions of early genius will here be highly
gratified, there being great numbers of original paintings, and some
copies, executed by the only son of the worthy proprietor of Guy's
clift, whose premature death at the age of twenty-two, caused
inexpressible grief to all who were honoured with his acquaintance.
Exclusive of these, there are others by artists of the greatest
celebrity.</p>

<p>The ancient pleasure grounds exhibit a great variety of pleasing
objects, and also numerous curiosities; among others, a mill that was in
being before the Norman conquest, it being mentioned in doomsday book.
There is also Guy's well, where this renowned champion was accustomed to
slake his thirst, which is described by Leland as follows, it still
remaining in the same state as it was then&mdash;&quot;The silver wells in the
meadows were enclosed with pure white sleek stones, like marble, and a
pretty house, erected like a cage, one end only open, to keep corners
from the rain.&quot; The apartments under the chapel, where the chantry
priests were used to reside, still remain entire, without having
undergone any alteration. Near to this spot is Guy's cave,</p>

&quot;Where with his hands he hew'd a house,<br>
Out of a craggy rock of stone,<br>
And lived, like a palmer, poor,<br>
Within that house alone.&quot;<br>

<p>This bears the appearance of being a natural eave, for the upper part
does not exhibit any marks where the tool has been made use of, but the
lower part does; and here, tradition says, this mighty warrior was
interred, and also his wife, fair Phillis. Over this cave is fair
Phillis's walk, who, it is related, was accustomed to resort here,
whilst her husband, though not known to her as such, was performing his
devotions in the cave below. From these delightful and romantic walks
there are numerous opportunities for an expert draughtsman to exercise
his abilities.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Leamington Priors.</i></p>

<p>The distance between Warwick and Leamington is only two miles, and there
are two distinct roads, both of them excellent; and whether a person
rides or walks, if the mind is susceptible of pleasing ideas, neither
time nor fatigue will be thought of. The roads about Leamington are in
excellent order, and present numerous delightful and picturesque views,
which are fully described by Mr. Field, and also by Mr. Moncrief in his
Guide to Leamington, wherein he has introduced some appropriate,
entertaining, and amusing poetry. Whoever resorts to these saline
springs in search of amusement, if he has money and time at command,
cannot fail, during the season, between May and November, of being
highly gratified, except the mind is entirely depraved. To every
visitant, the guide of Mr. Moncrief will not only be useful but
entertaining. The poetical epistles of Miss Fidget are not only
descriptive but very humorous, and the poetry of Mr. Pensile is very
appropriate.</p>

<p>Before Leamington rose into esteem, there was a facetious man resided
there, named Benjamin Satchwell, by trade a shoemaker, who, when any
differences arose among the villagers, he was in general the mediator;
they not being at that time cursed with either a wrangling lawyer or an
hypocritical methodist. He was also the village poet, and frequently
exercised his talents in praise of the waters, and likewise of any
respectable person who came with intent to derive benefit from them. He
is said to have kept annals in verse of its rise and progress, and also
cases of cures performed by the virtues of the saline spring, and that
he let them out to the visitors for their amusement, on certain terms.
Admitting this to be true, is it not very singular that Mr. Bisset, nor
his predecessor, Mr. Pratt, should neither of them introduce these jeu
des esprits, for the entertainment of their readers, or why did not Mr.
Moncrief collect them together; they certainly would have increased the
sale of his work? As they are overlooked by the local historians, it is
not likely that a casual visitor should stumble upon them.</p>

<p>This village having for a series of years been celebrated for a spring
of saline water, it has for some time become fashionable to resort
there. The first baths were erected in the year 1786, now called the
Centre well, by Mr. Thomas Abbotts, a native of the place; the
beneficial effects of the water having been noticed and recommended by
Dr. Kerr, of Northampton, and Dr. Allen. At this time there were two
baths, one of them hot and the other cold, which for several years
afforded sufficient accommodation for all invalids who resorted there,
and were in general lodged at the adjacent cottages, there being no more
than two small inns, the Bowling Green and the sign of the Dog.</p>

<p>Dr. Edward Johnstone, of Birmingham, having recommended the use of these
waters to several of his patients, the number of visitants increased
annually, so that in 1790, Matthew Wise, Esq. caused another well to be
opened, now called the Road well, where he erected a range of baths,
more spacious than the others, to which was annexed considerably more
conveniences, with some pretensions to elegance; but as yet no
additional apartments were provided for the accommodation of strangers,
except a few more of the cottagers fitting up additional rooms, it being
no more than a rural and retired village.</p>

<p>In the year 1794, Dr. Lambe, a physician of eminence, who resided at
Warwick, published in the fifth volume of the Memoirs of the Manchester
Philosophical Society, an accurate analysis of the Leamington water, by
which it appears to possess the same genial influence on the human frame
as the water of Cheltenham, which was then rising into celebrity. There
was one very material difference between the waters of Leamington and
those of Cheltenham, there being at the former place an abundant supply
of the mineral water, not only for drinking but for hot and cold
bathing; whilst, on the contrary, the saline spring at Cheltenham
scarcely produced a sufficient quantity for drinking. The influx of
visitors to Leamington now increased with such rapidity, that every
cottager exerted himself to fit up lodgings, and every house to which
lodgers resorted improved their appearance; in short, new wells were
opened, new houses erected, and not only new streets formed in the old
town, as it was now called, but a plan was drawn for the erection of a
new town, which has within a few years increased in a most astonishing
manner.</p>

<p>The Dukes of Bedford and Gordon, attended by their Duchesses, having
visited and remained at Leamington for some time, it induced the Earl of
Aylesford, who is lord of the manor, and of course, proprietor of the
spring, to visit Leamington, where, having made the necessary enquiries,
he gave orders that the spring should be properly inclosed, at his
expense, securing to the poor the benefit of the waters, and had he
lived, it was his intention to have erected baths for their
accommodation. The visitants increasing in number, Mr. Wise has
augmented the number of his baths, there being one cold bath, four hot
for the use of gentlemen, seven for ladies, and one for children, all
fitted up with Dutch tiles, or Derbyshire marble, and furnished for the
convenience of invalids, with hand rails: to each of the baths is
attached a dressing room, with a fire-place in it. Adjoining these baths
there is a small but elegant pump-room; the water being raised by a
horse engine.</p>

<p>In 1810, a fourth well was opened, which is called the Bridge well, and
is situated near the bridge, close to the river: it belongs to Mr.
Robbins, who has erected one large cold bath, three hot baths, and one
for children.&mdash;These, with the exception of the last, are accompanied by
convenient dressing-rooms; the water being raised by a horse engine.</p>

<p>The South well, the property of the Rev. Mr. Read, was opened in the
same year, (1810), where there are one cold bath, formed with Dutch
tiles, three hot baths, one of them being marble, and one for children:
these baths are very neat, but they have not the convenience of
dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>During the same year, (1810), a sixth well was opened on the north side
of the river, where a magnificent suite of baths and a spacious
pump-room are erected, at the expense of twenty-five thousand pounds;
there are twenty in number, hot, cold, tepid, vapour, and shower; one of
them being a chair bath, which is an admirable contrivance to immerge
the invalid, on the chair where he was undressed, into the bath, in a
secure and easy manner.&mdash;These baths are spacious, and admirably
constructed with Dutch tiles, and most of them have the accommodation of
dressing-rooms. The water is raised by a steam engine of two horse
power; and to the great credit of the proprietors, they have devoted one
hot and two cold baths to the use of the poor. This extensive building
exhibits a noble front, the central part being one hundred and six feet
in length and thirty in height, to which there are two wings, each of
them extending thirty-feet and in height twenty. A spacious colonade,
formed by double pillars of the Doric order, encompass it on three
sides, all of native stone, makes this building rank among the first and
most magnificent structures in the kingdom. It was designed and executed
by Mr. C.S. Smith, architect of London. The baths for the use of the
ladies are nearest to the river, and those at the other end are for
gentlemen, the entrance to them being from the two wings. The entrance
to the pump-room, which is extensive, lofty, and of exact proportions,
is through folding doors at each extremity of the central building.&mdash;The
ornaments of the ceiling, the cornices, and in fact, the whole interior
embellishments, are chaste and simply elegant. On one side the light is
introduced through seven windows, and on the opposite side by one window
of large dimensions, composed of stained glass. Underneath this window
there are two elegant chimney pieces, formed of Kilkenny marble. At the
western extremity of the room, on an ornamental pedestal of Derbyshire
marble, there is the pump, if it may be so called, it having a bason in
the centre, which is enclosed by a neat mahogany ballustrade. The
visitors receive the water in glasses from beautiful damsels, and to
whom it is usual to give a gratuity. The terms for drinking the water at
these baths is 3s. 6d. per week, exclusive of the gratuity. At the other
wells it is 2s. 6d. per week, and the gratuity. The terms for bathing
appear to be in general, 3s. for a warm bath, 2s. for that of a child,
and 1s. 6d. for a cold bath, with a gratuity to the attendant.</p>

<p>In the year 1816, a seventh well made its appearance in Clemens-street,
which bears the pompous title of the imperial sulphuric medical font,
and ladies' marble baths. There are here four baths, with a
dressing-room to each, and also an elegant pump-room.</p>

<p>Lest seven wells and fifty baths should not be sufficient to accommodate
the visitors at Leamington, preparations are making for the eighth well,
near Ranelagh gardens, where the baths are intended to be more splendid
than any of the former, and also the pump-room, under the title of the
Spa.</p>

<p>From the hour of seven to nine in the morning is the accustomed time to
promenade and drink the water, though numbers defer it till after
breakfast, and bathe in the evening before they retire to rest.</p>

<p>When the warm baths are not in use, they are invariably kept and shewn
empty, being filled in presence of the visitor, or during the time he is
preparing to use them; the process of filling not requiring more than
three minutes. The cold baths are in general emptied and of course
filled every day, or more frequently if required; but of late they are
not much resorted to, the warm or tepid bath being preferred. The
prevailing opinion among medical men is, that the latter is by far the
more efficacious in most disorders, and more conducive to health than
the former; because, where a person continues immersed in saline water
for some time, it enters into the pores of the skin, and by that means
is more likely to be of benefit in cutaneous or other disorders for
which it is usually recommended.</p>

<p>The houses in Union-parade, Upper Union-street, Cross-street, and
others, being erected, some public-spirited gentlemen, in order to
attract the attention of the public, in the year 1813 resolved to erect
an assembly-room that might vie with, if not excel those of Bath and
Cheltenham.</p>

<p>This, at the expense of ten thousand pounds, was carried into execution
by a pupil of the celebrated Wyatt. The spacious front of this beautiful
edifice is constructed with native stone, wherein no superfluous
ornaments are admitted. In the central part there are a range of seven
windows, supported by light pilasters of the Ionic order, surmounted by
a plain entablature. Two handsome wings project from the main building,
and judiciously relieve it; they contain those apartments that are usual
and necessary appendages to a large assembly room.&mdash;There are two
entrances into this building; one on the eastern side, from
Union-parade, through a small porch, supported by four Ionic columns;
the other, the principal entrance, is from Upper Cross-street, through a
pair of large folding doors in the right wing, into the hall. The hall
is spacious and well-proportioned, the refectory being opposite to the
entrance. To the right is a billiard-room, containing a massive mahogany
table, made by Fernyhough, of London, said to be worth one hundred
guineas, and to the left a flight of stairs conducts you to another
billiard-room, which, although it is not quite so spacious, is equally
commodious as the other. On the same side you enter the ball-room
through a pair of folding doors: this magnificent room measures in
length eighty-two feet, in width thirty-six, and in height twenty-six.
From the ceiling, which is beautifully ornamented with stucco, three
superb chandeliers of cut glass are suspended, which with those in the
other apartments are said to have cost one thousand guineas. The range
of windows aforementioned are furnished with curtains of crimson
moreen, edged with black fringe. On the opposite side of the room there
are two fire-places, the chimney pieces being formed of Kilkenny marble,
highly polished, over which are two ornamental mirrors of large
dimensions. At the upper end is the orchestra, to the left of which is a
door leading into the card room, which is a spacious and elegant
apartment, and beyond it is a reading-room, well provided with the
London and provincial newspapers, to which are added some of the most
esteemed periodical publications. On ball nights, this room is
appropriated for tea. From the month of June till November balls are
held every Thursday night, at eight o'clock, and card assemblies
occasionally throughout the season. The whole concern is under the
direction of a committee, the master of the ceremonies being C.
Stevenson, Esq.</p>

<p>Mr. George Stanley, mason, of Warwick, laid the first brick of the first
house erected at new Leamington, 8th October, 1808. This first house was
built by Mr. Frost, of Warwick, and stands at the comer of Upper
Cross-street, opposite the assembly rooms; in honour of him there is now
a street bears his name, (Frost-street.)</p>

<p><i>The Theatre.</i></p>

<p>This neat building, upon a diminutive scale, was erected in 1814,
immediately in front of the Bath hotel, the exterior appears to be
coated with Parker's cement, and the interior is ornamented with views
of Leamington, Warwick, Guy's Clift,  and c, and fitted up with some taste.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Post Office.</i></p>

<p>This necessary and convenient place for all descriptions of people to
resort to, is situated about two hundred yards east of the church, where
there are gardens, kept in neat order, for the accommodation of those
who wait with impatience for their letters; or they may promenade from
the office to Gordon house.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Ranelagh Gardens</i></p>

<p>Are regularly improved every season, and with their various amusements,
are deserving of attention.</p>
<br>

<p><i>The Church</i></p>

<p>Is an ancient pile of building, dedicated to All Saints, which, from the
great influx of visitors, being found too small for their accommodation,
an entire new wing was constructed in 1816, and it still requires to be
farther extended, or a new one erected. A moderate subscription from the
wealthy visitors would do much towards it. The officiating minister, the
Rev. E. Trotman, is only engaged to do single duty on a Sunday, but to
accommodate the visitors, he performs a second entire service, and to
remunerate him for his attention, subscription books are opened.
During the season of 1818, another hotel was begun, upon which twenty
thousand pounds being appropriated to the completion of it, is a sum
sufficient to render it equal to any other house of entertainment in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>An elegant suite of rooms have recently been opened, entitled the
Apollo, where assemblies were held every fortnight, during winter.
Boarding houses are continually opening every week, and in every quarter
of the town there are good houses in a state of forwardness, against the
present season.</p>

<p><i>A Hint from the Editor</i>.</p>

<p>From the rapid manner in which the buildings encrease at Leamington, it
is evident that there is a superabundance of money, and as soft water is
a scarce article within the town, could not a portion of that
superfluous money be advantageously employed in conveying that useful
and necessary article to the respective houses, by means of a steam
engine, there being a powerful spring at no great distance?</p>

<p><i>To Meriden, twelve miles, on the road to Coventry.</i></p>

<p>You proceed through Deritend and Bordesley, when you take the left hand
road, and having crossed the Warwick canal, the ruins of Bordesley house
are in full view; they having continued in that state ever since the
year 1791, when the house was demolished by an infuriated mob. The land
by which it is surrounded has been parcelled out, and advertised to be
let for building. On the left is a farm-house, denominated the Garrison,
from whence there is an extensive view over the town of Birmingham; and
on this eminence it is supposed that Oliver Cromwell planted his
artillery to overawe the town; but the majority of the inhabitants being
favourable to his cause, there was no necessity to make use of it; and
what gives weight to this supposition is, that this spot being about
one mile and a half from Aston hall, it is very probable that from
thence the artillery played upon that mansion, as a ball penetrated into
the interior of it. At the distance of three miles and a half, there is
a road on the left, which leads to the village of Yardley.</p>

<p>Having passed the four mile stone, you ascend a gently rising hill, and
when at the summit a delightful and extensive view presents itself;
there being a windmill in the front, and on the left the tower of
Sheldon church is seen, and also the steeple of Coleshill church.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Elmdon Hall.</i></p>

<p>The seat of A. Spooner Lillingston, Esq. is an elegant modern pile of
building, on the right of the road, at the distance of six miles. It is
situate in an extensive lawn, interspersed with shrubberies, from whence
there are variegated and extensive prospects, the churches of
Birmingham, Solihull, and Yardley being distinctly seen, backed by
Barr-beacon, the Rowley hills, etc. and withoutside of the lawn the
spire of Coleshill church is a pleasing object. The church, which is a
neat stone building, was erected by Abraham Spooner, Esq. the entrance
is under the tower, which admits of exhibiting to great advantage, an
elegant window composed entirely of stained glass. In the centre is a
representation of the last supper, delicately executed in a circle,
about nine inches in diameter, date 1532. There are also three ovals,
representing Faith, Hope, and Charity, executed in a masterly manner,
apparently about the same period. There is also a neat organ, of a size
suitable to the place.</p>

<p>At a short distance farther, there is on the right a church upon an
eminence, with a delicate spire, at a place called Church Bickenhill;
and a short distance beyond is an extensive and variegated prospect,
with Coleshill church on the left. Having crossed the river Cole at
Stonebridge, at the distance of half a mile on the left is Packington
hall, the seat of the Earl of Aylesford, which is a substantial modern
stone building, situated in a park, wherein are some of the most noble
oak trees that are to be found in the kingdom. There are also numerous
sheets of water, and the church, which was erected by the late Earl,
after a plan of Bonomi's, which is an immense arch, both interior and
exterior, after the manner of the Italians, and is nearly in the centre
of the park. The organ was made by order of Handel, and presented by him
to the late Earl; it being esteemed a very fine toned one.&mdash;The
altar-piece represents angels paying adoration to the Saviour, and is
painted in a masterly style by Rigaud.</p>

<p>The archery ground made use of by the woodmen of Ardeu is bounded by a
plantation on the left of the road, about one mile before you arrive at
Meriden. The members of this society hold several meetings each summer,
when they shoot for various prizes. On the ground there is an elegant
building erected, where the members dine, or take refreshment, and at
other times it serves as a general deposit for their bows and arrows.
This is almost the only society of woodmen now in the kingdom. At
Meriden there is a commodious inn, adjacent to which are delightful
gardens, and the accommodation for travellers are excellent.</p>
<br>

<p><i>To Sutton, distant eight miles, on the road to Lichfield.</i></p>

<p>You leave Birmingham, through Aston-street and the adjacent buildings in
the parish of Aston, which extend for a considerable distance along the
road. Having passed the buildings, you soon after cross a small stream
of water, that has performed its office of turning a corn mill, which
you perceive on your left hand. This mill was within memory a forge, for
the making of bar iron.&mdash;There is another mill upon the same stream, a
short distance above, known by the name of Aston furnace, which was a
blast furnace for the purpose of making pig iron to supply the forge
below, and must have been made use of as such for a prodigious number of
years, the slag or refuse from it forming an immense heap only a few
years back, which has been conveyed away to make and repair the roads,
and in some instances to erect buildings.<a name="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> This mill has been
considerably enlarged, and a steam engine erected contiguous to it, and
is now used as a paper mill.  From an adjacent hill there is a good
view over the town of Birmingham.</p>

<a name="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor9">[9]</a><div class=note> See Hockley abbey, on the road to Wolverhampton.</div><br>

<p>A lofty brick wall now presents itself to view, by which the park
belonging to Aston hall is surrounded: it being by computation three
miles in circumference; within which there is a great abundance of
valuable timber, and it is also well stocked with deer. When the wall
recedes from the high road, keep by the side of it, which leads you to
the parish church, and also to the mansion house or hall, which is a
brick building, erected by Sir Thomas Holt, about the year 1636, at the
same time that he enclosed the park. He also erected alms houses, for
five men and five women, which he endowed, with eighty-eight pounds per
annum, out of the manor of Erdington. The hall has of late years been in
the possession of Heneage Legge, Esq. but is at present unoccupied, and
the whole estate is upon sale.<a name="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor10">[10]</a><div class=note> Since writing the above, the mansion of Aston, together
with the park, has been purchased by Messrs. Greenway and Whitehead, of
Warwick, who have converted the house into two tenements, disposed of
the deer, turned the park into enclosures, and fallen the timber.</div><p>

The church which is dedicated to St. Peter and Paul, is a stone
building, with a lofty spire, and contains several monuments of the Holt
family; it is also ornamented with two windows of stained glass, by
Eginton. In the church-yard there is a remarkable grave stone, which is
fixed east and west.<a name="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The present incumbant is the Rev. Benjamin
Spencer, L.L.D.<br>

<p>Sir Lister Holt, the late proprietor of this estate, not having any
children, and being at variance with his only brother, (who succeeded to
the title), he entailed the estate upon four different families, none of
whom had or are likely to have any children, although they have been in
possession of it for the space of near forty years.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor11">[11]</a><div class=note> It is a thick stone, about two foot in height, on which is
the following inscription:&mdash;

<p>Returning into the main road, you perceive on the left a double row of
lofty elms, that extend about half a mile; and at the termination of the
vista, Aston hall and the lofty spire of the church produce a grand
effect. On the right there is a sheet of water that turns a mill for the
use of the Birmingham manufacturers. You soon after cross Salford
bridge, to the right of which is an aqueduct that conveys the Birmingham
canal over the river Tame. The village of Erdington does not contain any
object deserving of attention, but a little beyond on the right is Pipe
hall, an ancient seat of the Bagot family, now occupied by the Rev.
Egerton Bagot.</p>

<p>In the vicinity there are several neat houses, which are chiefly
inhabited by wealthy people, who have retired from Birmingham. A short
distance from hence Mary Ashford was found drowned on the 27th May,
1817.</p>

<p>About the fifth mile stone, the eye is gratified on the left with an
extensive view over the country, which continually varies for a
considerable distance, until a most beautiful and picturesque landscape
presents itself; a white house belonging to a mill and an extensive
sheet of water being in front, Barr-beacon in the back ground, and the
woods in Sutton park on the right.</p>

<p><i>Sutton Coldfield.</i></p>

<p>This remarkably neat and clean town is situated about midway between the
town of Birmingham and the city of Lichfield; lying south from the
latter place, its name is supposed to be derived from South Town, and by
corruption, Sutton. There is a very considerable portion of land near
this town, where travellers say the air is equally sharp and cold as it
is upon the highlands of Scotland, and from this circumstance the latter
part of its name originates. Independant of this tract of land, there is
another contiguous to it, which is denominated the park, wherein a part
of the Roman road, called Icknield Street, still remains perfect; there
is also a spring called Rounton well, whose water is remarkably cold and
produces a very copious stream, to which numerous people who are
afflicted with cutaneous disorders resort, and derive considerable
benefit from drinking and bathing therein. It cures the most virulent
itch in the human species, and also the mange in dogs, if sufficient
care is taken to wash them well in the stream, but a slight washing will
not produce the desired effect.</p>

<p>The church is an ancient stone building, dedicated to the Holy Trinity,
and the present rector is the Rev. John Riland, who is also patron of
the living. Within the church there is an organ, and some monuments
deserving of attention; there are also three vaults, two of which having
been opened, the coffins and their contents were mouldered into dust,
although they had been deposited there within the memory of man.</p>

<p>This town was incorporated by the eighth Henry, at the solicitation of
Vesey, bishop of Exeter, who was his chancellor, and a native of this
place. It is denominated a corporate body, by the name of the warden and
society of the king's town of Sutton Coldfield, and consists of
twenty-four members besides the warden, with a grant to them of the
whole manor and lordship of the parish, together with a tract of waste
ground, called the park, containing about 3500 acres, wherein is great
abundance of valuable timber, on condition of paying into the exchequer
a fee farm rent of fifty-eight pounds per annum.</p>

<p>The said Bishop Vesey erected fifty-one stone houses in the parish and
also a free grammar school, which he liberally endowed with land, and
ordained by the statutes, that the master should be a layman, which is
strictly adhered to. He also procured for the inhabitants a market, and
the extraordinary privilege that every person who erected a house in
Sutton, should be entitled to sixty acres of land in the park.</p>

<p>Here are two fairs annually, for horses, neat cattle, and sheep; the one
on Trinity Monday and the other on the 8th of November; when, for every
horse that is sold, a toll must be paid of four-pence, and a reputable
voucher produced by the person who sells it; the marks and age of the
animal being registered. By the same charter, the inhabitants of Sutton
are exempt from toll in all fairs and markets. The deputy steward or
town clerk holds a court of record every three weeks, for the trial of
civil actions, and holds to bail for forty shillings and upwards.</p>

<p>Sessions, court leet, and other customary courts are held, and the
charter expressly says, that they shall have and exercise as much
privilege and power as the city of Coventry; but this they do not
practise, for they commit felons to the county gaol. Every inhabitant is
a landed man, which is drawn by ballot every four years; and no county
officer can enter this franchise, to arrest, etc. without especial
license.</p>

<p>The town of Sutton is seated on such an eminence, that although there
are fourteen large pools of water within the parish, and some of them
very extensive, there is not the smallest stream runs into it; the town
being supplied with water by springs within it. The air is very
salubrious, the water in general soft, the situation delightfully
pleasant, the neighbourhood genteel, and accommodations in general very
excellent. In the vicinity is Four-oaks hall, the seat of Sir E.C.
Hartopp; Moor hall, the residence of ---- Hacket, Esq. and
Ashfurlonghouse, which is at present unoccupied.</p>
<br>

<p><i>To Halesowen, seven miles, on the road to Hagley, Stourbridge and
Kidderminster.</i></p>

<p>You proceed up Broad-street and Islington, through the five ways
toll-gate; when the road inclining to the right, there is a double range
of respectable houses, denominated Hagley-row, which have been erected
by the opulent inhabitants of Birmingham; where they not only enjoy
fresh air, but the parochial taxes of Edgbaston do not bear any
proportion with those of Birmingham. On the right hand is an
observatory, a lofty brick building, seven stories high, which bears the
name of the Monument: it was erected by John Perrot, Esq. about the year
1758, from whence there is an extensive view over the adjacent country
in every direction. The house adjourning is the residence of John Guest,
Esq. Having passed the one mile stone, the admirer of nature will
proceed with solemn pace and slow, every step he takes varying the
scene; one object being lost to view, which is succeeded by another
equally beautiful. On the left there is an extensive and picturesque
prospect, which continues without interruption for a considerable
distance; and when the scene closes on that side, turn your eyes to the
right, where there is a landscape equally fine; which, over the
inclosures, takes in Smethwick, with Shireland hall in the front. A very
short distance farther on the left there is an extensive and variegated
landscape, with a house called the Ravenhurst in full view; the prospect
being bounded by Bromsgrove Lickey and Frankley Beeches. At the three
mile stone is the Lightwoods, a neat brick house, the property and
residence of Miss Grundy, from whence there are some enchanting
prospects. In these woods there are small shrubs grow in great
abundance, which produce black fruit, known by the name of bilberries,
of which during some years the poor people make a plentiful harvest.&mdash;
Ascending the hill there is a delightful view over the enclosures,
commanding the villages of Harborne and King's Norton; the two parish
churches being conspicuous objects. From the Beech-lane there is a fine
view, having the hills of Clent and Cofton in the distance.</p>

<p>At a place called the Quinton, near the five mile stone, there is a
grand prospect, and from this eminence there arise two springs, one of
which flows into the Severn and the other into the Trent. On the left is
Belle Vue, the residence of James Male, Esq. from whence, as its name
imports, there is a grand panoramic view of the country, that fills the
mind with the most sublime ideas, such as cannot be described either by
pen or pencil. In descending the hill opposite some cottages, there is a
road leading to
<i>The Leasowes.</i></p>

<p>Wherein the inimitable Shenstone took so much delight, and decorated in
such a manner, that in his days they were spoken of and resorted to by
all people of refined taste, who came within a day's ride; and not an
individual ever left them without expressions of astonishment at what
they had seen and heard from the worthy proprietor, who warbled forth
his verses in such a melodious manner, and on such subjects, that
delighted every ear, as his diversified shady walks did every eye.</p>

<p>His remains were interred in the church-yard of Halesowen, to whose
memory, some years afterwards, a small stone pillar, with an urn on the
top of it, was fixed near the vestry door, within the church, but has
since been removed within the chancel, to make room for a magnificent
marble monument, to the memory of Major Halliday, executed by Banks, for
which he received about one thousand pounds; there being on each side of
it a figure, large as life; one representing Patience and the other
Fortitude.</p>

<p>On the pillar to the memory of Shenstone is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

Whoe'er thou art, with rev'rence tread<br>
These sacred mansions of the dead.<br>
Not that the monumental bust,<br>
Or sumptuous tomb, here guards the dust<br>
Of rich, or great,(let wealth, rank, birth,<br>
Sleep undistinguished in the earth.)<br>
This simple urn records a name,<br>
That shines with more exalted fame.<br>
Reader! if genius, taste refin'd,<br>
A native elegance of mind;<br>
If virtue, science, manly sense;<br>
If wit that never gave offence;<br>
The clearest head, the tend'rest heart,<br>
In thy esteem e'er claim'd a part;<br>
Ah! smite thy breast, and drop a tear;<br>

<p>The Leasowes are now in the possession of Matthias Attwood, Esq. and
these delightful walks, although their beauties have been curtailed to a
considerable degree, by conveying the Netherton canal across the valley,
close by them, are still highly deserving the attention of all persons
who take delight in rural scenery; and for the accommodation of those
who are inclined to meditate and contemplate, numerous seats are
affixed, in different directions. Such scenes as these walks afford are
very seldom to be met with in any part of England; therefore those who
are in pursuit of amusement, will not regret if they devote one day to
view them; and as they consist of hill and dale, it will of course cause
some fatigue, which may with ease be alleviated, there being close at
hand a neat and comfortable house of entertainment, kept by Betty
Taylor. The source of the river Stour is in these grounds.</p>

<p>When near the bottom of the hill, the road divides; that on the right
leads to Stourbridge, and the other to
<i>Halesowen, in Shropshire.</i></p>

<p>This place has been considered as a borough, by prescription, from time
immemorial, and is supposed to have been represented in parliament at a
very early period; but what ancient writings they were in possession of,
being (as I am informed), conveyed to London and never returned, they
have now none to exhibit. A court leet is held annually, when two
officers are appointed, under the appellation of high and low bailiff;
but I cannot understand that they enjoy any emolument, or are in
possession of any jurisdiction. In the reign of King John, he founded a
monastery here, and the church is supposed to have been erected about
the same period; it being an ancient building, dedicated to St. John;
with a lofty spire. The present incumbent is the Rev. ---- Robinson.
Near a mile distant there are still some remains of the monastery, and
to the professed antiquary there is probably something deserving of his
attention. In digging two holes to fix a gate, a short time since, there
was found a considerable quantity of stained glass, in small fragments,
some few of which are preserved, as are also some square tiles or
quarries, about five inches broad and one thick, with curious devices
upon them. It is now denominated the manor farm, and is the property of
Lord Lyttleton. Dr. Nash, in his appendix to the history of
Worcestershire, gives the following extract from the papers of Bishop
Lyttleton.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Halesowen Abbey.</i></p>

<p>This ancient structure was situated about half a mile south of the town,
on what is now called the manor farm, near the road leading to
Northfield. King John, in the 16th year of his reign, granted a charter
to Peter de Rupibus, bishop of Winton, by which he gave the manor and
advowson of the church of Hales, with its chapels, to found a religious
house in this place. In consequence of this grant, a convent of
Praemonstratensians was established A.D. 1218, dedicated to the Virgin
Mary and St. John the evangelist, and furnished with monks from the
abbey of Welbeck, in Nottinghamshire. This religious order were canons,
who lived according to the rule of St. Austin, and afterwards reformed
by St. Norbet, at Praemonstre, in Picardy. They were called white
canons, from their habit; which consisted of a white cossack, with a
rotchet over it, a long white cloak, and a white cap. They continued
under the jurisdiction of the abbot of Praemonstre, who received
contributions from them, till the year 1512, when they were exempted by
Pope Julius 2d. The churches and a large proportion of the tythes of
Walsall, Wednesbury, Rushall, Clent, and Rowley, were granted to this
convent, by successive monarchs, which was also richly endowed by
opulent individuals. The abbot and convent held ten large farms in their
own hands. In the reign of Henry 8th, the clear income amounted to
&pound;380 13s 2d. a large sum, considering the value of money in those days.
In 1489, when the whole number of religious amounted only to seventeen,
there were every week consumed in bread 20 bushels of wheat and rye. And
in the course of the year, 1110 quarters of barley, 60 oxen, 40 sheep,
30 swine, and 24 calves; a proof that great hospitality and charity
prevailed here at that time. The monastery consisted of an abbot, prior,
sub-prior, sacrist, chanter, cellarer, and custos infirmorum: the monks
never exceeded twenty in number.</p>

<p>At the visitations of their superiors, punishments if requisite were
inflicted for immoralities. The house and church appear to have been
stately edifices; the chancel, if not the whole of the choir, being
paved with flat tiles, painted in a curious manner, some of them being
now occasionally found; and the few ruins still extant cover an
extensive plot of ground, exhibiting fine specimens of Saxon and Gothic
architecture.</p>

<p>Several persons of note have been buried in the church, particularly
John, Lord Botetourt, baron of Weoleigh castle, near the high altar,
under a tomb of alabaster; Sir Hugh Burnell, also baron of Weoleigh; Sir
William Lyttleton, of Frankley, and others, about the year 1507.</p>

<p>This monastery was dissolved A.D. 1558, by Henry 8th. The common
sigillum, or chapter seal, was in the reign of Henry 4th, a
representation of the blessed Virgin, in a sitting posture, with the
infant Christ on her left knee, and in her right hand a sceptre. The
arms of this abbey were, azure a chevron argent, between three fleur de
lis.</p>

<p>The situation of Halesowen is in a deep valley, and the surrounding
country presents the most majestic appearance; being diversified with
hills and dales in such a manner, that at every step you take new
beauties arise, and the scene varies so much, that the eye is
unceasingly delighted, without dwelling upon any particular object. This
district cannot, properly speaking, be described, either with pen or
pencil: the innumerable varieties of similar objects that present
themselves to view, must be seen before any person can form the least
idea of them.</p>
<br>

<p><i>To Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire, distant thirteen miles,</i> <i>on the road
to Worcester, Glocester, and Bristol.</i></p>

<p>You proceed up Smallbrook-street, when a spacious road opens to the
left, and being clear of the buildings, the spire of King's Norton
church, which is six miles distant, forms a pleasing object.</p>

<p>On the left you have a picturesque view of the country, which continues
without any intermission nearly the space of three miles. There is in
this valley, what is very unusual to be seen in such a situation, a
windmill; and as you proceed, there are in the same valley several water
mills, that are made use of by the Birmingham manufacturers. This view
is skirted by buildings erected on the road to Alcester, and when near
the two mile stone, you perceive among the trees, Moseley hall, which is
a modern stone building; the residence of Mrs. Taylor. Exactly,
opposite, on the right hand, is the parish church of Edgbaston, and also
the hall, which is surrounded by a park, wherein are some lofty trees,
and an extensive sheet of water. This mansion house, or hall, is now
occupied by Edward Johnson, M.D. a person of considerable eminence in
his profession.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond the three mile stone the road crosses the
Worcester canal; from which bridge, if you look towards Birmingham,
there is a rich and variegated landscape, consisting of hill, dale,
wood, and water. At the four mile stone there is a most extensive view
on each side of the road, and also in front; the spire of King's Norton
church, Frankley Beeches, and the Clent hills, being prominent features.</p>

<p>Having passed the five mile stone, there is on the right a beautiful
view over the enclosures, backed by the beeches, at Frankley. Before you
arrive at the six mile stone is Northfield, from whence there is on the
left a beautiful landscape; the elegant spire of King's Norton church
being distinctly seen. From hence to Bromsgrove is seven miles, in great
part over the Lickey, where the eye is gratified with numerous extensive
views, from one of the highest spots of land in the kingdom. This is
ascertained by two springs that issue from it, one of which, flows into
the Severn and the other into the Trent.</p>

<p><i>To Coleshill, distant ten miles, on the road to Atherstone.</i></p>

<p>You leave Birmingham through Coleshill-street, and having passed by
Ashted-row, you perceive the lofty trees in Vauxhall gardens, which must
be left on the right hand, and a few hundred yards afterwards, keeping
the right hand road, you pass by, on the right, Duddeston, an elegant
pile of building, the residence of Samuel Galton, Esq. but it is
scarcely discernable, on account of the shrubberies by which it is
surrounded. You now pass through the village of Saltley, and at the
extremity, on the left, is Bennett's hill, where Mr. William Hutton, the
venerable historian of Birmingham resided, and ended his days. This
residence, so denominated by the proprietor, was originally a very small
house, with the entrance in the centre, and a small room on each side,
to which has been added two wings, or rather rooms, being only one story
in height: there is a wall by the road side, five feet high, the top of
which is on a level with the top of the parlour windows; the entrance to
it having been altered from the front to the side. The eccentricity of
the owner appears, by terming that a hill, which on inspection will be
found in a low situation, on the side of a hill. This is noticed,
because his peculiar manner of writing, his quaint expressions, and the
tales he relates of himself, have caused a considerable sale for his
productions, and numerous people, when they are taking an excursion,
will travel some distance to view the residence of their favourite
author.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond, on the summit of the hill, commands an
extensive view of Birmingham, the venerable trees in Aston park, the
spire of that church, and Barr-beacon. As you pass along the road, this
delightful prospect varies every step you take for a considerable
distance. These lands, formerly known by the name of Washwood heath,
being inclosed in the year 1803, now let from forty to fifty shillings
per acre.  At the four mile stone, there is on the right a cheerful
prospect over the country, with the lofty spire of Yardley church in
full view. About half a mile farther, on entering a small common, the
eye is delighted with an extensive and variegated view; the spire of
Coleshill church being very discernable.</p>

<p><i>Castle Bromwich, distant five miles and a half</i>.</p>

<p>Here is an ancient venerable mansion, where that eminent statesman, Sir
Orlando Bridgeman, used to reside. His successor having been honoured
with the title of Earl of Bradford, the eldest son of the present Earl,
Lord Newport, has fixed his residence here. In the village is a neat
place of worship, erected by Sir Orlando Bridgeman, who endowed it with
the tythes of the parish, it being a chapel of ease to the parish of
Aston.</p>

<p>About half a century back, when there was considerable traffic between
London and Chester, the road passed through this village, and supported
two respectable inns, but the mode of conveyance being changed, one of
the inns is converted into a farm-house, and the other has very little
custom; for the road from Birmingham to Coventry also passed through
here; but it is totally deprived of that also, and is now little more
than the road to Coleshill. On the road you pass by Coleshill park, an
ancient seat of Lord Digby; within which there are numerous hawthorn
trees of unusual magnitude: one of them produces five stems, each equal
in size to a moderate man's body. Time, that devours every thing, has
here made great havoc among them, and also destroyed some oaks of large
dimensions.</p>
<br>

<p><i>Coleshill</i>.</p>

<p>Yew trees being of slow growth, and the wood of close texture, are
little subject to decay; yet there is in this church-yard, the remains
of a yew tree, still alive, three parts at least of which is mouldered
away, and only a small part of the trunk remains.</p>

<p>The architecture of the church is the decorated gothic or English style:
it is erected on a considerable eminence, from whence there is an
extensive and variegated view over the adjacent country. The interior of
the church, which is dedicated to St. Peter, is spacious, and contains
some monuments that are well executed; among others, there are two
recumbent effigies of cross-legged knights, supposed to be of the
ancient Clinton family, and those to commemorate the Digby's are
numerous. It has a beautiful tower, from whence there arises an elegant
spire, which being injured by lightning, it was of course taken down,
and the present erection is not so lofty by fifteen feet as the former.</p>

<p>Coleshill has a weekly market on Wednesday, and five annual fairs, where
there are numerous horses and cattle exposed to sale. Before the
establishment of mail coaches it was a very considerable post town, but
that is not the case now, the route being changed. The town is situated
on an ascent, and in the valley flows the river Cole, from whence its
name is derived. The domestic buildings are in general of a respectable
appearance, and there are some modern erections that unite ornament
with spacious dimensions.</p>

<p><i>Shustock</i>.</p>

<p>This village is situated three miles from Coleshill, on the road to
Atherstone, and is noticed as being the birthplace of that celebrated
antiquarian, Sir William Dugdale, whose father being a clergyman, he was
born at the rectory house, and dying at Blythe hall, his remains, and
those of his lady, were deposited in a vault on the north side of the
chancel in Shustock church.</p>

<p><i>Maxstoke Castle</i></p>

<p>Is situated about one mile east of Coleshill, and is erected in the form
of a parallelogram, encompassed by a moat. At each corner is an
hexagonal tower, with embattled parapets. The entrance is by an august
and machicolated gateway, strengthened on each side by a tower of
hexagonal form. The gates are covered with plates of iron, and the marks
of the useless portcullis are yet visible. A portion of this edifice was
accidentally destroyed by fire, but the greatest part of the ancient
building still remains, and is an interesting specimen of the
architectural arrangements in the 14th and 15th centuries. Among other
apartments, are the spacious hall, an extensive dining room, with a door
and chimney piece, which are carved in a very curious manner, and also
the chapel. In the walls of the great court, there are yet remaining the
caserns or lodgments for the soldiers. This venerable pile of building
is now the habitation of Mrs. Dilke. A short distance from the castle
are the remains of a priory, whose ruins are rendered mournfully
picturesque, by the varieties of ever-green foliage with which they are
cloathed in almost every direction.</p>

<p><i>To Hat-borne, in Staffordshire, distant three miles.</i></p>

<p>Passing up Broad-street and Islington, when you are through the
Five-ways<a name="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> toll-gate, the centre road leads to Harborne. On the left
is a neat white building, called Greenfield-house, the properly and
abode of Hyla Holden, Esq. and a little farther on the same side of the
road is the parsonage-house of Edgbaston; the resilience of the Rev.
Charles Pixell.</p>

<a name="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor12">[12]</a><div class=note> There are now six ways, Calthorpe's road being opened in
the year 1845.</div><br>

<p>Passing by Harborne heath cottage, when you arrive at the summit of the
hill, is an excellent house, where Mr. Richard Smith resides; from whose
premises there is an extensive view over the adjacent country,
particularly Edgbaston and King's Norton.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond, on the right, there is a delightful view of
enclosed ground, and the Lightwoods; with a white-fronted house, called
the Ravenhurst, in the centre, the residence of Mr. Daniel Ledsam, which
altogether forms a beautiful landscape. Where the roads divide pass on
the left, leaving the village, called Harborne Town, which is
principally inhabited by men who obtain a livelihood by forging of
nails, and proceed down the road which leads to Bromsgrove, where on the
left is a preparatory school, for boys under ten years of age, which is
conducted by Mrs. Startin. This house commands a pleasant view over the
grounds that have been laid into a paddock by Mr. Price, whose neat and
elegant residence, with its beautiful undulated grounds, are also on the
left.</p>

<p>A few paces below Mr. Price's, you arrive at a small triangular grass
plot, which is called the cottage green, and is surrounded by cottages,
superior in neatness of appearance to what are usually met with. From
hence there is a most delightful landscape of Mrs. Careless's house,
which is surrounded with verdant meadows, having a considerable sheet of
water in front, and in the back ground are Frankley Beeches, with the
adjacent hills of Cofton and the Lickey.</p>

<p>There are in this vicinity some most delightful prospects, which are
seen to great advantage from the handsome houses of Mr. Green Simcox,
and also of his father, George Simcox, Esq. the former on the right hand
and the latter on the left, as you proceed towards the church. This is
an ancient tower Structure, the body having of late years been rebuilt
in a neat and commodious manner; consisting of a single pace, well
pewed, with a modern gallery at the west end and another at the north
east comer; It is a vicarage, dedicated to St. Peter; the present vicar
being the Rev. Richard Robinson.</p>

<p>From this church-yard the eye is again delighted with extensive and
beautiful prospects; and from thence, proceeding towards Northfield, a
bridge has been lately erected by subscription, which separates the
parishes of Harborne and Northfield, and also the counties of Stafford
and Worcester. The stream of water gives motion to a mill, belonging to
Mr. Price, and feeds the mill pond, which is a fine sheet of water
covering twenty-four acres. Not far from hence there is a delightful
shady walk, which extends through the grounds of Mr. Price and Mr. Simcox for near a mile, and at intervals commands delightful and
romantic prospects.&mdash;Within a few yards of the aforesaid bridge, the
counties of Stafford, Worcester, and Warwick unite.</p>

<p>Returning towards Birmingham, at the sign of the Golden Cross you pass
up Mitchley-lane, which separates the counties of Stafford and Warwick;
the land on the right being in the parish of Edgbaston, the property of
Lord Calthorpe, and on the left in Harborne, belonging to Theodore
Price, Esq. About half a mile up this lane, on the left, at Fulford's
farm, there is an interesting view over Mr. Price's paddock, of King's
Norton, with its lofty spire, Cofton hills, Bromsgrove Lickey, Frankley
Beeches, Cleat hills, etc. etc. Passing by a neat cottage belonging to Mr.
Frears, you come again into the Harborne road, at Mr. Smith's.</p>

<p>In this village there is a free school for the children of the
inhabitants, and also for those in the hamlet of Smethwick; but the
endowment is slender. Here are also three Sunday schools, which are
equal to any in the kingdom, the children being cloathed in a very neat
manner, by each of them subscribing one penny per week; and as all the
respectable inhabitants are honorary members, they subscribe one penny
each also. Formerly this was a very poor village, and the roads leading
to it were in all directions very bad, until the late worthy Thomas
Green, Esq. having purchased the manor house and a large estate there,
he afterwards improved the roads, and was at all times anxious to
improve this his native spot. A monument in the church describes his
character.----The old manor house was the residence of Judge Birch, and
the only respectable building in the parish; which is now a common
farmhouse, where there are some vestiges of old village elegance, and
some comfortable apartments: it is the property of Mr. Simcox. Harborne
being situated upon very high ground, and the soil light, renders the
air very salubrious; instances of longevity being very numerous,
particularly one couple, James Sands and his wife, one of whom; as is
recorded in Fuller's Worthies, lived to the age of 140, and the other to
120.</p>

<p><i>To King's Norton, in Worcester shire, distant five Mile</i>.</p>

<p>You leave Birmingham, either through Alcester-street or up Camphill,
where there is a half-timbered house, inhabited by Mr. John Simcox, an
attorney. In a field nearly opposite there is perhaps the best view over
the town of Birmingham that can be taken. A short distance beyond, on
the right, is a row of houses, to which is given the name of Highgate. A
little farther, on the left, is a tan-yard, upon an extensive scale, the
property of Mr. Avery Homer.</p>

<p>In a field near the two mile stone, there is a grand panoramic view of
Birmingham, and the adjacent country for several miles on each side of
it, which is seen to the greatest advantage in an afternoon. A little
beyond is Moseley hall, an elegant stone building, erected about
twenty-five years since, by the late John Taylor, Esq. and is now the
residence of his widow.</p>

<p>The village of Moseley has nothing to attract attention. The place of
worship is a chapel of ease to King's Norton: it has an ancient stone
tower, but the body of it has been rebuilt of late years with brick; the
officiating clergyman being the Rev. Edward Palmer. In this
neighbourhood William Villers, Esq. resides, who has for a number of
years been an active magistrate for the town of Birmingham. A little
beyond Moseley hall there is on the right an extensive and picturesque
view over Edgbaston and the adjacent country, with the monument oa the
right. Proceeding only a few yards farther, the scene varies in a
considerable degree; the monument being on the left, a glass-house in
the centre, and the front of Moseley hall in full view; over the roof of
which is seen some of the buildings in Birmingham.</p>

<p>Upon a turn of the road, the eye is gratified with a fine view over
Bromsgrove Lickey, Frankley Beeches, and the adjacent hills; with the
spire of King's Norton church on the left. You next pass through the
village of King's Heath, and about one mile before you reach King's
Norton, there is on the right a most noble, picturesque, and variegated
view over an extensive country, diversified with wood, hill, and dale;
the Worcester canal being in the valley. When you arrive at the finger
post, the eye is delighted with a grand view over the country; the
village and church being in front..</p>

<p><i>King's Norton</i></p>

<p>The land for a considerable distance round this village being the
property of the crown, as King's-heath, King's-wood, etc.; denote, King
Edward 6th founded a free grammar school on the north east side of the
church-yard, and endowed it with the sum of fifteen pounds per annum,
(the inhabitants at that time preferring money to land), for a master
and usher; which still remains the same to the present day. In the time
of King William 3d, when the land-tax was first established, the
inhabitants, to express their loyalty, gave an account of their estates,
at the full value, and on that account they have ever since been rated
in the same manner; this district paying four shillings in the pound, at
the same time that Birmingham did not pay four-pence. This being the
case, the stipend allowed for the master and usher was of course reduced
in that proportion. The Worcester canal passing through this parish, and
the land being considerably elevated, it enters a tunnel sixteen feet
wide and eighteen feet high, which continues for the distance of two
miles, and is so accurately formed, that it is said any person may look
in at one end and perceive the light at the other end; and in this
parish the Worcester and Stratford canals form a junction.</p>

<p>The church, is a richly ornamented gothic building, with a lofty spire,
although only a chapel of ease to Bromsgrwe. The officiating-clergy man
is the Rev. ---- Edwards.</p>

<p><i>To Barr-beacon and Aldridge, on the road to Stafford.</i></p>

<p>Proceeding down Walmer-lane, otherwise Lancaster-street, you pass by a
small portion of Aston park wall, keeping it on your right hand, and
some time after cross the river Tame over Perry-bridge, when there is a
road to the left which conducts you to Perry hall, an old moated
mansion, within a small park; the property and residence of John Gough,
Esq. who is an eccentric character. In the winter he courses with his
tenants, who are all of them subservient to him; and during summer,
having some deer, he disposes of the venison. If any of the neighbouring
gentry send him an order for a haunch or a neck, he waits until further
orders arrive; and when the principal part is engaged, he then kills a
buck, and executes his orders; the inferior parts serving for self and
family, although his annual income must be at least ten thousand pounds.
He is said to be in possession of some valuable paintings, but there are
very few people indeed who can obtain a sight of them.</p>

<p>At the distance of five mites, when the roads intersect each other,
proceeding on the right hand, at the distance of three quarters of a
mile is the catholic college, at Oscott. About one-mile farther is a
place called the Quieslet, where the left hand road conducts you to an
elegant lodge, the entrance into Barr-park, which is described on the
road to Walsall, that being a turnpike road. You soon after arrive at a
clump of trees, on the summit of a hill, which is Barr-beacon, from
whence there is perhaps a prospect equally extensive and beautiful as
any in the kingdom. From hence there is a view over great part of the
following counties, viz. Warwick, Leicester Derby, Stafford, Chester,
Salop, Worcester, Nottingham Northampton, Oxford, Crlocester, Hereford,
Monmouth, Brecknock, Radnor, and Montgomery; whilst the scene to the
south west commands a view of Birmingham and its most populous vicinity
of mines, manufactories, etc. This beacon, being the property of Sir
Joseph Scott, when he is at home, a very large flag is hoisted, and upon
any public occasion several pieces of cannon are fired, which produce a
grand effect. The adjacent ground, for a very considerable extent, lay
waste, until an act of parliament was obtained in 1798 for its
inclosure. This land now lets from five shillings to twenty shillings
per acre.</p>

<p><i>Aldridge, in Staffordshire, nine miles.</i></p>

<p>The principal road from Birmingham to Stafford lay through this village,
until of late years the turnpike road through Walsall and Cannock having
been considerably improved, this road to the county town is nearly if
not quite abandoned; yet it leads to Hednesford (usually pronounced
Hedgeford), where numerous horses are annually trained for the turf,
upon Cannock heath.  <i>To Edgbaston, in Warwickshire, distant one mile.</i></p>

<p>Having passed up Broad-street and Islington, when you are through the
turnpike, the left hand side of Ladywood-lane, the whole of Hagley-row,
the road to Harborne, Calthorpe's road, and the right hand side of
Islington-row, are all of them in this parish. Indeed the lands
hereabouts are almost exclusively the property of Lord Calthorpe, whose
ancestors purchased this estate, early in the last century for &pound;25,000,
and he will not permit any manufactories to be established upon his land
which tends in a great degree to make the neighbourhood respectable and
genteel.</p>

<p>The first Houses in Calthorpe's-road were erected in the year 1815; the
establishment for the deaf and dumb being erected about two years
before. This asylum is under the superintendance of Mr. Braidwood, and
is described among the public institutions in Birmingham.&mdash;(See page
39.)</p>

<p>There were, in former times, within this parish, three parks,
Edgbaston-park, Mitchley-park, and Rotten-park, but the two latter have
many years since been thrown into inclosures. The park of Edgbaston
remains entire, and the mansion within it is now the residence of Edward
Johnson, M.D. who is very eminent in his profession.&mdash;The church is an
ancient gothic tower, the body having of late years been very much
modernized, and fitted up withinside in a very neat and commodious
manner. The officiating clergyman is the Rev. Charles Pixell. There have
been within the last three years a great number of genteel houses
erected by the opulent inhabitants of Birmingham, who not only enjoy
fresh air, but the parochial taxes of this parish do not bear any
proportion with those of Birmingham. At this toll-gate, which bears the
name of Five-ways, there are now, by the opening of Calthorpe's road,
six separate and distinct roads. About half a mile from the toll-gate,
there is on the right of the Hagley road, an observatory, a very
conspicuous pile of building, seven stories high, which is usually
called the Monument: it was erected by John Perrot, Esq. about the year
1758, from whence there are extensive views over the adjacent country,
in every direction. The adjoining house is the residence of John Guest,
Esq.</p>

<p>There was in this church-yard a grave-stone, cut by the hands of that
celebrated typographer, Baskerville, (who was originally a stone-cutter,
and afterwards kept a school in Birmingham), which is now removed and
placed withinside the church. The stone being of a flaky nature, the
inscription is not quite perfect, but whoever takes delight in looking
at well-formed letters, may here be highly gratified: it was erected to
the memory of Edw. Richards, an idiot, who died 21st September, 1728,
with the following inscription :&mdash;</p>

If innocents are the favourites of Heaven,<br>
And God but little asks where little's given,<br>
My great Creator has for me in store<br>
Eternal joys; what wise man can have more?<br>

<p>There is another head-stone, cut by him, with his name upon it, in the
church of Handsworth, and are the only two known to be in existence.</p>

<p><i>Yardley, in Worcestershire, distant three miles.</i></p>

<p>The road to this village lies up Deritend and Bordesley, then crossing
the Warwick canal, you leave the ruins of Bordesley-house, and when
through the turnpike, there being three roads you proceed along the
centre, in which there are good accommodations for the pedestrian, but
the carriage road does not appear to have experienced any improvement
since it was first formed; for before you reach the village, the road is
for a considerable distance from twenty to forty feet below the surface
of the ground, on each side of it.</p>

<p>The church, which is dedicated to St. Giles, is an ancient pile of
building. The tower and elegant spire above it appear at this time as
firm and substantial as at their first erection, although they are so
ancient that there are not any records to say when they were built: the
body of the church is not so perfect. In the chancel there are several
monuments to commemorate the Greswolds, an ancient family, formerly
resident in this parish. The patronage rests with Edmund Mesey Wigley,
Esq. The present vicar is the Rev. Joseph Fell. Adjoining the
church-yard is an half-timbered building of large dimensions, which is a
free school, liberally endowed, the salary of the master being &pound;100 per
annum.</p>

<p>The land in this parish being very suitable for making of tiles,
innumerable quantities are there manufactured, for the supply of
Birmingham.</p>

<p><i>To Rowley Regis, in Staffordshire, distant seven miles</i>.</p>

<p>You proceed towards Kidderminster, until you arrive at the toll-gate,
two miles and a half distant, when the right hand road leads to this
village; where, in all probability, there are more jew's harps
manufactured than there are in all Europe beside.</p>

<p>The admirer of nature, (for no art has ever been practised here,) may be
gratified with various extensive and luxuriant views. There is not any
thing either in the church or in the village deserving of notice; but
there is, not far distant, a rude, rugged, and misshapen mass of stone,
which is situated on the summit of a hill, and projects itself several
yards higher than the ground adjoining: it is by the inhabitants
denominated Rowley hail-stone; and when at a considerable distance from
it, on the foot road from Dudley, it has the appearance of some
considerable ruins.</p>

<p>From this spot the views are more extensive than can easily be imagined,
over a beautiful and romantic country, Birmingham being vary visible.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
